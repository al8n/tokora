"""Emit one consumer probe for one added name, against its REAL owner.

The first version of this harness exercised every spelling on a local `Gadget`. That can
only collide with a name that is blanket-implemented for every `Sized` type — which was
true of exactly one item, the one already cut. `Gadget::parse_except` cannot collide with
`Ident::parse_except`; `Gadget.peek_kind()` cannot collide with `InputRef::peek_kind`. So
the probe is generated per item, against the owner the inventory records.

Usage:
    gen_probe.py <category> <name> <owner> <spelling>

Prints the probe crate's `src/lib.rs` on stdout. Exits non-zero — never silently — on a
category or owner it does not know how to express, so an unprobed name is a loud failure
rather than a green run over nothing.

`owner` for the trait categories is the TRAIT the item is declared on, and it is looked up
in `TRAITS` below rather than defaulted. It used to be defaulted, and that is the more
dangerous of the two shapes this file was missing: a probe riding a subject that does not
implement the trait constructs no collision and reports a clean run — a false green, which
is worse than the FATAL an unexpressible shape produces.

#
# The indirection below is not decoration and must not be flattened to a direct import.
#
# `run.sh` grants `new-owner` only on positive evidence: a base-side diagnostic that NAMES this
# row's owner. Every owner before this one lived in a module the base ref already had, so
# `use tokora::EmitterView;` failed as `unresolved import \`tokora::EmitterView\`` — the owner in
# the message. `tokora::diagnostic` is the first WHOLE MODULE a diff has added, and there the
# same shape reports the module instead: `unresolved import \`tokora::diagnostic\``, with no
# mention of `Code` anywhere in the output. Measured, all three spellings, on the base ref
# `c14b936`:
#
#   use tokora::diagnostic::Code;   -> E0432 `tokora::diagnostic`      (1 error, no `Code`)
#   use tokora::diagnostic::*;      -> E0432 `tokora::diagnostic`      (1 error, no `Code`)
#   impl .. for tokora::diagnostic::Code -> E0433 `diagnostic` in `tokora`  (3, no `Code`)
#
# rustc suppresses the follow-on `cannot find type \`Code\`` in all three, which is the right
# thing for a compiler to do and leaves the harness with no evidence: every row scores INCONCL
# while the head side is measuring exactly what it should.
#
# Re-exporting through a local module splits the one failure into two, and the second one names
# the owner:
#
#   error[E0432]: unresolved import `tokora::diagnostic`
#   error[E0432]: unresolved import `new_module::Code`
#
# The head side resolves both hops and is unchanged. Any future diff adding a module takes this
# shape; a direct import of a type inside a new module cannot reach `new-owner` at all.

# ── Which subject a trait probe rides ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# This was two hardcoded traits and an `else`:
#
#     recvr = "try_num" if owner == "TryParseInput" else "parse_num"
#
# so EVERY trait that was not `TryParseInput` silently got `parse_num` — a receiver that
# implements `ParseInput` and nothing else. For a name declared on any other trait the probe
# would then collide with nothing and report a clean run over an experiment that never
# happened, which is a false green and strictly worse than refusing. The two-line comment
# above the hardcode said exactly that and the code did not obey it.
#
# So the subject is looked up, and an absent trait is FATAL. Each field answers one question,
# and a probe that needs a field the trait does not supply refuses rather than defaulting:
#
#   recvr    a VALUE satisfying the trait's bound, for a `self`-taking method.
#   self_ty  a TYPE satisfying it, for a receiver-less associated function — path resolution
#            has no receiver to walk, so the collision is `Type::name(..)` and needs a type.
#   scope    how a consumer brings the trait into scope. `None` means the shared fixture
#            already imports it. A trait the release ADDS cannot be imported by name: that
#            import does not resolve on the base side and the row goes INCONCL, measuring
#            nothing — so a new trait is reached through a module glob, which is a legal
#            consumer spelling on both sides.
#   fixture  extra source the subject needs, or `None`.
#
# ── THE TRUST BOUNDARY: `recvr` IS NOT POLICED BY THE RUN ─────────────────────────────────
#
# Read this before adding or editing a row. Nothing below is checked by anything; the table is
# an assertion its author makes, and for some row shapes it is the ONLY protection there is.
#
# The run cannot verify that `recvr` names a value the trait is actually implemented for. It
# has no witness to key on: a subject that does NOT implement the trait constructs no collision
# and reports a clean run, which is byte-identical to the clean run a correct subject produces
# whenever the consumer's item wins at an earlier pick. Both score `ok*`, both sides agree, and
# both leave the same `CONSUMER-CALLS` witness — there is no column in which they differ.
#
# That is not a hypothesis. It was MEASURED (issue #225) for the shape it bites hardest:
#
#   A `&mut self` trait method on a NON-DEREF subject. The consumer is `impl<T> ConsumerComb
#   for T`, so it supplies a candidate at every pick, and `trait_method`'s three spellings
#   declare `self` or `&self` — both EARLIER than `&mut`, and on a non-deref value there is no
#   later step to fall through to. The consumer's item therefore claims the call at pick one or
#   two and tokora's is never a candidate, no matter WHAT the receiver is. Swapping
#   `emitter_value()` for a receiver that implements nothing produced the identical `7u8` from
#   the consumer's item and the identical witness on both sides — a byte-identical `ok*`. The
#   row cannot be falsified by running it.
#
# So for such rows the blessed record is TRUSTED, NOT VERIFIED, and the written justification in
# `no_collision.txt` — read by a human who agrees with it — is the entire mechanism. The only
# consumer that would genuinely compete declares `&mut self`, collides at the same pick, and is
# E0034-loud; `trait_method` cannot generate it. This is a property of METHOD RESOLUTION, not a
# gap in the templates, so no amount of generator work converts it into machine detection —
# see issue #225's ruling, which declines exactly that work and records why.
#
# What follows for an author: pick `recvr` from a type tokora demonstrably implements the trait
# for (the fixture's own types, not a convenient one), say in the row's `no_collision.txt` entry
# WHY the subject satisfies the bound, and never read a green `ok*` on a `&mut`-self row as
# evidence that the subject was right. `EMITTER_SUBJECT_FIXTURE` above is the worked example.

# ── The subject for `tokora::types::recovery`, and WHY IT IS NOT `Ident` ─────────────────
#
# Both traits are implemented for `Ident` and for `Keyword`, and `Ident` is the one already in
# the shared fixture's import list — so it is the obvious pick and it is the WRONG one, which
# is a fact rather than a preference. `Ident` has carried inherent `is_valid`, `is_error` and
# `is_missing` since long before the base ref, and an inherent item outranks every trait item
# at the same step of the receiver walk. Measured, on the `later_pick_discarded` spelling: the
# probe compiled, ran, reported `CONSUMER-CALLS: 0` and scored `new-owner` — over a call that
# went to `Ident`'s OWN pre-existing method, with `RecoveryState` reported unused in the same
# log. Three false verdicts in one run, in the exact shape this harness exists to refuse.
#
# `Keyword` declares no inherent `status`, `is_valid`, `is_error` or `is_missing` — check that
# before moving this subject, because the check is what the choice rests on — so tokora's trait
# item is the only candidate of that name on it besides the consumer's. `run.sh`'s fifth witness
# now REFUSES the `Ident` shape rather than trusting this note, but the note is what tells the
# next author which way to move when it fires.
#
# The import is deliberately NOT wrapped in `#[allow(unused_imports)]`, and that is load-bearing
# rather than an oversight: `unused import: `new_module::RecoveryState`` IS the fifth witness's
# evidence, and an allow is a witness that cannot fire. `trait_scope`'s `scope` field carries
# that allow for its own documented reason, which is why these two traits reach the probe
# through `fixture` instead.

    # that is the whole content of their rows. `tokora::diagnostic` publishes a contract for a
    # CONSUMER's error types to implement; tokora's own errors do not implement it, and the
    # module's header says so in as many words. `DiagnoseExt` is blanket over `D: Diagnose`, so
    # it reaches exactly as far.
    #
    # There is therefore no receiver, anywhere in this crate, on which tokora's items are
    # candidates — so every row here AGREES on both sides and is justified by name in
    # `no_collision.txt`. Read the README's bound before reading the verdict column: a subject
    # that does not implement the trait produces a clean run that means nothing, and here that
    # is the FINDING rather than a mis-chosen subject. `UnexpectedEot` is picked deliberately as
    # one of tokora's own error types — the natural first candidate for a `Diagnose` impl — so
    # the row says "even there, tokora's item is not a candidate" rather than "some unrelated
    # value does not implement it".
    #
    # Reaching `Diagnose::code` at all costs a consumer two source changes they make
    # themselves: implementing the trait for their own type, and importing the trait. Neither
    # can happen to a call site that already exists because tokora published a name.
    #
    # RE-OPEN CONDITION, and it is not optional: the first time tokora implements `Diagnose`
    # for one of its own types, `recvr` becomes a value of THAT type and these rows are
    # re-probed. Until then the entry below is trusted, not verified, and the justification in
    # `no_collision.txt` is the whole of its protection.

    # `scope` stays absent for the same reason it is absent on `Emitter`, arrived at from the
    # other direction: an import of a trait the base ref does not have makes the base side fail
    # to compile, which destroys the before-state and scores every row INCONCL. A pre-existing
    # glob cannot reach these names either, because the module is new and the crate root does
    # not re-export them.

    # ── `ErrorContainer` — a PRE-EXISTING trait gaining two DEFAULTED items ─────────────────
    #
    # `Option<E>` is one of the four types tokora implements `ErrorContainer` for, and the one
    # that needs no construction and carries no inherent item of its own to confound the
    # receiver walk (`Vec::clear` would). `PErr` is the fixture's own error type, so the impl
    # being exercised is tokora's `impl<E> ErrorContainer<E> for Option<E>` at a real `E`.
    #
    # `scope` IS needed, and it is not the `Emitter` case: `ErrorContainer` is pre-existing, so
    # the import resolves on both sides — but the shared fixture does not import it, and without
    # the import tokora's item is a candidate nowhere and every row is a clean run over an
    # experiment that never happened.
    #
    # `self_ty` is the same subject in the type namespace, and it is filled in because #284 adds
    # the trait's first RECEIVER-LESS item since it shipped: `from_errors` declares no `self`, so
    # its row is a `trait_assoc_fn` and needs the path form. It used to be absent on the reading
    # that `new`/`with_capacity` were the only receiver-less items and both pre-existing — true
    # when it was written, and exactly the kind of statement that stops being true the moment the
    # trait gains a constructor. A `None` here is FATAL rather than a skipped row, so the harness
    # would have reported the gap rather than swallowing it.
    #
    # READ THE HEADER ABOVE BEFORE READING A VERDICT HERE. `clear` takes `&mut self`, so it sits
    # at a strictly LATER pick than either consumer item `trait_method` can generate (`self` and
    # `&self`) — the consumer wins on both sides, the row AGREES, and agreement here is the
    # foreknown outcome rather than evidence of safety. That is #225's ruling; the rows are
    # justified by name in `no_collision.txt` rather than read as green. `from_errors` is the
    # other shape and is expected `loud`: a path call walks no receiver chain, so tokora's item
    # and the consumer's are both applicable at the one pick and rustc refuses to choose.

        "recvr": "Option::<PErr>::None",

    # ── `TrackerExt` / `RecursionTrackerExt` — tokora#265's split of the combined checks ────
    #
    # Both are NEW traits: `Tracker` and `RecursionTracker` are PRE-EXISTING (the four
    # primitives — `increase_token`/`increase_recursion`/`decrease_recursion`/`check` and
    # `increase`/`decrease`/`check` respectively), but the *combined* update-and-check
    # operations used to be `Tracker`'s own provided methods and now live on these two
    # blanket-implemented extension traits instead — see `TrackerExt`'s own doc for why
    # (a type could override a provided method and disambiguate to the wrong trait's `check`;
    # a blanket impl makes that unrepresentable). So `scope` follows the `CastNode` precedent,
    # not `Emitter`'s: a NEW trait cannot be imported by name — that import does not resolve on
    # the base ref and the row goes INCONCL — so each is reached through a glob over its own
    # module instead, which is NOT new (only the trait inside it is), so the glob itself
    # resolves unchanged on both sides.
    #
    # `recvr` is each trait's own module-mate rather than a shared subject reached across a
    # second module: `RecursionLimiter` (`impl RecursionTracker for RecursionLimiter`) sits in
    # `state::recursion_tracker` beside `RecursionTrackerExt` itself, and `Limiter`
    # (`impl Tracker for Limiter`) sits in `state::tracker` beside `TrackerExt`. Either row
    # could have ridden `Limiter` instead — it implements `Tracker`, `TokenTracker` AND
    # `RecursionTracker` all at once, constructed with `Limiter::new()` — but that would pull a
    # second glob into `RecursionTrackerExt`'s scope for no gain: one type per trait, from the
    # trait's own module, is the simpler, more direct implementor and matches the standing
    # precedent (`Lexer`'s subject is "the one type in this fixture the trait is demonstrably
    # implemented for", `State`'s is "tokora's own implementor rather than a stand-in").
    #
    # No `let` binding, mutable or otherwise, and none is needed: `recvr` is spliced directly
    # into `{recvr}.{name}(ARGS)`, so `Limiter::new()` / `RecursionLimiter::new()` is a fresh
    # temporary at the call site, and Rust lets a `&mut self` method borrow a temporary's place
    # for that one statement — the identical shape `emitter_value()` and `lexer_value()` already
    # ride. `fixture` therefore stays absent: no helper function or setup is needed beyond the
    # glob import, and both constructors are `pub const fn new() -> Self` with no arguments.
    #
    # READ THE HEADER ABOVE BEFORE READING A VERDICT HERE. Every item both traits declare takes
    # `&mut self`, with no other trait-shaped alternative on either subject, so this is the
    # identical foreknown-vacuous shape `Emitter`'s row is: `trait_method`'s three consumer
    # spellings declare `self` or `&self`, both strictly EARLIER in the receiver walk than
    # `&mut self`, and neither subject is a deref target — so the consumer's blanket item wins
    # at pick one or two on every row, no matter what the receiver is. #225's ruling applies; a
    # green verdict here is trusted on the written justification, not on having exercised
    # tokora's item.
    #
    # `self_ty` stays absent for both: neither trait declares a receiver-less item (every method
    # on both takes `&mut self`), so no `trait_assoc_fn` row can arise, and filling it in "just
    # in case" is how a probe ends up riding a guess.

    # ── `RecoveryState` / `FromComponents` — a NEW trait in a NEW module ────────────────────
    #
    # The first owners here that the same diff introduces AND that live in a module the base ref
    # does not have. Both facts matter and they are answered in different places:
    #
    #   * the module is new, so a direct `use tokora::types::recovery::RecoveryState;` fails on
    #     base as `unresolved import `tokora::types::recovery`` — the MODULE, with the owner
    #     suppressed — and every row scores INCONCL for want of a diagnostic naming the owner.
    #     `new_module_imports` splits that into two errors, the second `unresolved import
    #     `new_module::RecoveryState``. Measured on `a218439`, exactly the `tokora::diagnostic`
    #     shape that function was written for.
    #   * the owner is new, so the BASE side cannot compile and no row here can reach `loud`,
    #     `silent` or `ok*` — those all need a before-state. The three verdicts a new owner can
    #     reach are `new-owner` (head takes the call), `new-owner-err` (head refuses to choose)
    #     and `new-owner-nc*` (the consumer wins an earlier pick, justified by pick order).
    #
    # Which one each spelling lands on is decided by ONE fact: every item on both traits takes
    # `&self` or no receiver at all, and the `trait_method` spellings are named for a tokora
    # method taken BY VALUE. Against `&self` there is no LATER pick for the consumer to sit at —
    # `same_pick` (`self`) is one pick EARLIER and wins outright; `later_pick_*` (`&self`) is the
    # SAME pick and rustc refuses to choose. So no spelling here can produce a silent steal, and
    # that is a property of the receiver kinds rather than of these names. It is the mirror of
    # `Emitter::commit_lexer_error`, one receiver step over: there tokora's `&mut self` is later
    # than every consumer spelling, here tokora's `&self` is earlier than or equal to all of them.
    #
    # `FromComponents::from_components` takes no receiver, so it is a `trait_assoc_fn` and its
    # rule is path resolution rather than a walk: the consumer's `impl<T> ConsumerAssoc for T`
    # and tokora's trait are both applicable to `Keyword` and rustc reports E0034. That is the
    # `loud` verdict that category's docstring predicts, reached on the one side a new owner has.

# ── The pratt error types, as probe subjects ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# `RecursionLimitReached` and `NonAssociativeChain` are the two error types the recursion
# bound introduced, and they are the first owners in this harness that the SAME diff also
# introduces. Read `run.sh`'s `new-owner` verdict before reading a row for one of them: the
# probe below names the owner, so it cannot compile on a base ref where the owner does not
# exist, and that absence is the finding rather than a broken probe.
#
# The subject is BUILT rather than obtained from a tripped parse. The receiver has to be a
# value on the line where the call is made, and a parse that trips hands the error back
# through the grammar's own `From` — which for the fixture's `PErr` has already discarded it.
# Both types are plain `Copy` values with a public constructor, so building one directly is
# both simpler and closer to what a consumer holding one would have.
#
# Each record answers: which concrete type the consumer's extension trait is implemented for,
# how a path call spells it, what the probe must import, and how to build one.
#
# BOTH are listed even though #147's inventory routed every shared name to
# `RecursionLimitReached`. `of`, `offset`, `offset_ref` and `map_offset` exist on both types, and
# `inherent_owners` records ONE owner per name — so which of the two a row rides is decided by
# rustdoc's iteration order, not by anything in this file. An entry for only the winner would be
# a template that works until that order changes and then reports FATAL over names it has
# already probed. The two share `error_subject_method` / `error_subject_assoc_fn`, so the second
# entry is one record rather than a second code path, and the path that serves it is the one

# ── Inherent subjects whose OWNER this same diff introduces ──────────────────────────────
#
# `EmitterView` and `Cst` are minted by the diff that adds their items, so the BASE side cannot
# resolve the owner at all and the only verdict a row here can reach is `new-owner` — which
# `run.sh` grants on four witnesses, the last of which is that the HEAD side reached
# `witness=0`: compiled, ran, and let tokora's item take the call. A head that fails to compile
# scores INCONCL instead, "a broken probe on the side that was supposed to prove the owner is
# new".
#
# So for these owners the call is built at the item's REAL arity and the `used` spelling binds
# the item's REAL return type. That is #158's lesson, applied to the two owners this release
# mints: a fixed zero-argument `-> u8` call put 9 of `RecursionLimitReached`'s 14 rows in
# INCONCL because the head side never compiled.
#
# The rule INVERTS for a PRE-EXISTING owner (`InputRef`, `ParserContext`, `ParseState`): there
# the BASE side must compile and it has only the consumer's own item, so the binding stays the
# consumer's `u8` and a head-side E0308 is the honest `loud` verdict. Do not move an owner
# between the two shapes without moving it between these two rules.
#
# WHICH names can reach these tables is bounded, not merely observed. `surface_diff.py` assigns
# each name ONE owner, the alphabetically LAST of those declaring it — `inherent_owners[nm]` is
# overwritten inside `for owner, _ in sorted(...)`. `Cst` < `EmitterView` < `InputRef` <
# `ParseState`, so these two owners can only ever receive the names they declare ALONE: every
# forwarder `EmitterView` shares with `InputRef` or `ParseState` is routed to those instead. The
# tables below are complete for their owners rather than a subset that happens to work today,
# and a name outside them is a loud refusal naming what to add.

    # order moves.
    #
    # `diagnostic::Severity` needs no entry and has none, and the reason is worth writing down
    # because it is a property of the harness rather than of the type: owners are identified by
    # UNQUALIFIED name, and `emitter::Severity` already declares `as_str` on the base side, so
    # `diagnostic::Severity::as_str` is absent from the inventory — masked by a same-named type
    # in another module. Its analysis is `Code::as_str`'s exactly (a new owner no call site can

    # declare will surface and land here.
