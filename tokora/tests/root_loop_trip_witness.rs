#![cfg(all(feature = "std", feature = "logos_0_16"))]

//! The input-side **terminality readings**, used the way a consumer outside this crate uses them.
//!
//! `InputRef::trip_snapshot` / `tripped_during_attempt` and their scanner twins
//! `scanner_trip_snapshot` / `scanner_tripped_during_attempt` were crate-private for as long as the
//! only sites judging an attempt were this crate's own. The descent pair is public now because a
//! consumer acquired the defect they exist for: a **hand-written document-root loop** that catches
//! a failed definition and has to decide whether that failure ends the document. The scanner pair
//! is still crate-internal, and the public scanner verdict is `InputRef::at_scanner_stop` — a
//! reading of the live stop rather than a baseline-and-compare, for the reason section 4 measures.
//!
//! Every other suite that touches these counters drives them through a *combinator* —
//! `tokora/tests/collection_resource_trip.rs` through the collection drivers,
//! `tokora/tests/collection_terminal_stop.rs` through the same four families under a scanner
//! limiter. None of them proves what publishing these readings is for, which is that a loop this
//! crate did not write can judge its own failure. That is what this file drives, and it drives it
//! from `tokora/tests/`, so nothing here can reach a `pub(crate)` item.
//!
//! # The shape, and the amplification it prevents
//!
//! The consumer loop is
//!
//! ```text
//! loop {
//!   let trips = inp.trip_snapshot();          // per DEFINITION — inside the loop
//!   match definition(inp) {
//!     Ok(true)  => {}                          // parsed one, keep going
//!     Ok(false) => return Ok(()),              // input ended
//!     Err(e) => {
//!       if e.is_terminal() || inp.tripped_during_attempt(trips) { return Err(e); }
//!       report(); // an ordinary syntax error: file it and carry on
//!     }
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! and the term that matters is the second half of the disjunction. Without it — which is the loop
//! smear shipped before al8n/smear#169 — a nesting refusal is filed as an ordinary syntax error and
//! the loop carries on, re-reading the abandoned nest at document level and reporting once per
//! remaining unit. Section 1 measures that: the report count is 0 with the witness and equal to the
//! document's length without it, at three lengths, so what is pinned is the *growth* and not one
//! number.
//!
//! # The placement that compiles and is wrong — section 2
//!
//! The baseline is a value the caller places, and **where** it is placed is the whole verdict.
//! Taken once above the loop it is arithmetically a session-absolute read for every definition
//! after the first: the counter is monotone, so a refusal any earlier definition caught keeps
//! answering "tripped" for the rest of the document. Section 2 runs the hoisted loop beside the
//! per-definition one over a source whose first definition catches its own refusal and whose next
//! three fail ordinarily. The per-definition loop files all three; the hoisted one files none and
//! ends the document on the first. The widened-budget control is what makes the pair a
//! measurement: with nothing refusing, the two agree.
//!
//! The *other* wrong placement — the scanner baseline taken per element rather than per collection
//! — is pinned in-crate, beside the pair it belongs to, because that pair is not public. See
//! `input::input_ref::tests`.
//!
//! What is no longer testable here is the session-absolute reading itself. `trip_snapshot()`
//! returns an opaque `ResourceTripBaseline`, so `!= 0` does not compile, the difference of two
//! baselines does not compile, and a baseline cannot be stashed and carried into another handle
//! invocation. Those are compile-fail doctests on `InputRef::trip_snapshot`; what survives to be
//! measured at runtime is placement, which no type can decide for a caller.
//!
//! # The scanner half, and why it is not a counter — sections 3 and 4
//!
//! `try_expect` folds a terminal scanner stop into the same `Ok(None)` it uses for a genuine end of
//! input, so a root loop reaches its "the document ended" arm holding **no error**. The obvious
//! answer is the input-side scanner *counter*, and it is the wrong one: `set_state` / `state_mut`
//! re-key the forward-scanning facts and dropping the poison boundary there is the crate's
//! *documented* limit-recovery path, while the counter is monotone and never cleared. A loop that
//! recovers that way reads the whole document and the counter still says truncated. That pair is
//! therefore crate-internal, and `InputRef::scanner_trip_snapshot` records the measurement.
//!
//! [`InputRef::try_expect_or_stop`] is what a consumer reaches for **on the declining exits**, and
//! section 3 is the three cells that show it right in all three of those positions: truncated,
//! untruncated, and recovered.
//!
//! It is not the whole answer, and section 4 is the exit it cannot reach: a *rejecting* emitter's
//! trip is built and propagated from inside that very call, before it can raise a terminal stop, so
//! the caller gets an ordinary-looking error over an exhausted scanner and no delegation in its
//! `MaybeTerminal` can recover the fact. [`InputRef::at_scanner_stop`] is what a root loop reads
//! there — the **live** stop, at the committed cursor, taking no baseline. Section 4 measures both
//! directions of it: without the reading a re-keying root loop files one diagnostic per remaining
//! token at three document lengths, and with it the *documented* recovery still finishes the
//! document — the row a monotone counter answers wrongly, and the reason the counter pair is not
//! what was published.
//!
//! # Two readings, and which question each answers — section 5
//!
//! `at_scanner_stop` is **positional**: is a stop on record *at the committed cursor*. Its own
//! docs name the residue that costs — an element's lookahead can trip, latch the frontier *ahead*
//! of the cursor and still return `Ok` with a short window, and every positional witness reads
//! clean there while the stop is live and already diagnosed.
//!
//! `InputRef::scanner_stopped_during_attempt` is the **attempt-relative** reading that closes it:
//! the session's scanner-trip counter, which is outside the rollback set, conjoined with a stop
//! still being latched — presence, not position. Section 5's five-point table (latched ahead,
//! draining, at the frontier, re-keyed, recovered) is measured under both emitters; rows 1-2 are
//! the gain and rows 4-5 are why a monotone counter's permanent false positive does not survive.
//!
//! Neither boolean is a sufficient **root-loop** guard, and `InputRef::scanner_outcome` is the
//! shape that is. A trip inside a speculative wrapper is restored away together with the tally
//! that took it, so every live reading of the input is correctly clean while the caller holds the
//! trip-derived error at the position the attempt began — a loop guarded on a boolean retries the
//! identical scan for ever.
//!
//! The outcome partitions that by the `Lexer` determinism clause's own three inputs. `Stalled`
//! means all three are unchanged — source, an offset **equal** to the capture's, and the same
//! lexer regime — so a repeat reproduces the trip. Each way that can fail has its own arm rather
//! than being folded in: `ReKeyed` when the documented `set_state`/`state_mut` recovery replaced
//! the regime without moving the offset, `Rewound` when a rollback landed below the capture,
//! `Progressed` when the parse committed past it. The capture is **affine** — one capture judges
//! one attempt — because a reusable one recreates the very retry the arm exists to close, and
//! `InputRef::judge_scanner` binds capture, work and verdict into a single turn so neither
//! placement exists to get wrong.
//!
//! Its lexer is deliberately **not** the earlier sections': `SLexer`'s tally lives behind an
//! `Rc<Cell<_>>`, which the `Lexer` determinism clause names as a contract violation — *"a shared
//! counter"* — and a state a restore cannot rewind cannot decide a question about restores.
//! Section 5's `CLexer` holds the crate's own `TokenLimiter` by value, which is the placement that
//! contract requires; the one cell that still drives the shared counter says so in its own name
//! and carries no argument.
//!
