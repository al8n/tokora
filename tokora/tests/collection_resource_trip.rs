//! A **descent** budget trip inside a collection element re-raises; it is not spent as a diagnostic.
//!
//! The four try-driven collection families — `repeated`, `separated`, and their delimited forms —
//! swallow an element's `Err` by design: emit it and keep looping. Their gate re-raises what no
//! further input can clear, and until issue #148 it recognized only two of the three such
//! conditions. The third, a [`RecursionLimitReached`], latches no boundary — it has a control stack
//! rather than a position — so `inp.at_committed_boundary()` reads `false` for one and the trip fell
//! through to the swallow arm: emitted as an ordinary diagnostic, with the loop continuing to the
//! next element. The gate now also reads the session's **resource-trip counter**, which the trip arm
//! bumps before the grammar's `From` runs.
//!
//! # Attempt-relative, and why half this file is about that
//!
//! The counter is a **monotone session fact**: it says a budget was exceeded somewhere in this
//! parse, and it is never cleared, because nothing can un-exceed a budget. That is not the question
//! the gate has. The gate is judging **one element**, so it snapshots the counter before the element
//! runs (`inp.trip_snapshot()`) and re-raises only when the count moved *during* it
//! (`inp.tripped_during_attempt(..)`) — the same baseline-and-compare shape the sibling absence
//! witness already uses through `latch_snapshot`/`latched_during_attempt`.
//!
//! Read absolutely the two answers come apart exactly where grammar code catches a trip itself and
//! parses on: the session has tripped forever after, so every later element failure in every later
//! collection re-raises, ordinary syntax errors included. One deeply-nested expression early in a
//! document would then suppress every diagnostic after it — which is precisely wrong for the
//! editor and language-server consumers this crate is built for. Section 2 below is that regression;
//! section 3 pins that narrowing the witness did not put a hole in it.
//!
//! # The exit with no `Err` in it — section 4
//!
//! Everything above is about the `Err` an element hands back. An element that **answers the trip
//! itself** hands back `Ok`, and the gate never runs: the driver takes an *absence* exit — the
//! element declining, or a cycle that committed nothing — reads it as "no more elements", and the
//! collection **succeeds**. Same defect, same sink-independence, reached through the exit the
//! failure chokepoint does not cover; the resource budget stopped the parse and the parse reported
//! a complete construct. `parser::many::absence_after_element` is the second chokepoint, and
//! section 4 drives both absence exits of all four families through it. Its cells are the inverse
//! of section 2's: there a caught trip must change nothing, here it must change the verdict, and
//! the two sets of sources differ only in *where* the catch sits relative to the element the driver
//! is judging.
//!
//! # The exit that closes on a real token — section 5
//!
//! Section 4's delimited sources all end on a close MISS, so they never reach the arm where the
//! closer is genuinely present. There the two witnesses come apart. A `CloseStatus::Close` verdict
//! is cache-first, so it rests on a real pre-trip token: the construct ended **ahead of** any
//! boundary the element's lookahead went on to latch, which makes the *scanner* latch simply not
//! about it — gating on that would fail a parse a wider scan window completes to the identical
//! value. The *descent* trip is the other kind of fact, a counter event that already happened inside
//! the element attempt, and no later token unmakes it: an element that caught one, declined, and was
//! then followed by a real closer closed the collection **successfully** while a resource budget had
//! stopped the parse. `parser::many::close_after_element` is the third chokepoint, holding the
//! descent witness alone, and section 5 is section 4's delimited cells with the closer put back.
//!
//! # The exit that stays open, by design — section 6
//!
//! Sections 4 and 5 are both about an element that *answers* a trip and then concludes absence —
//! declining, or stalling — which is a conclusion the driver draws and therefore a conclusion the
//! driver has to guard. An element that answers a trip and reports `Accept` concludes nothing: it
//! hands the driver a value, and the driver collects it exactly as it would from an untripped
//! element. Neither `absence_after_element` nor `close_after_element` is reached on that path, on
//! purpose, and section 6 is **not** a residual — it is the permanent shape of the design, stated
//! by `parser::many`'s module docs and pinned here so it cannot drift silently in either direction.
//! Section 7 is the contrast that makes the distinction legible: the gap it closes *was* a residual,
//! recorded as one, and is now gone.
//!
//! # The other eight drivers — section 7
//!
//! Sections 4 and 5 cover the four try-driven families. The other eight guard-bearing sources — the
//! four `*_while` collection drivers and the four fold sources — had the same hole, for a reason
//! narrower than the four's rather than different: they never file an element's `Err`, so a trip an
//! element *hands back* propagates untouched and is terminal there with no gate at all. What they
//! could not see is the same `Ok` sections 4 and 5 are about. Closing it needed the per-element trip
//! baseline none of those loops took — which is why three of the folds stopped being `while let`
//! loops, a `while let` having nowhere to snapshot the counter before the element attempt its own
//! condition runs. Section 7 drives every one of the eight.
//!
//! **THIS SECTION PINS DELIBERATE, EXISTING BEHAVIOUR.** Every cell in it is expected to pass
//! against the code as it stands; a red here does not mean something is broken; it means the
//! boundary moved — either narrower (an `Accept` started being gated, which would strand a grammar
//! that deliberately recovers a value from a caught budget) or wider (a decline/stall/closer exit
//! sections 4 or 5 gate stopped being gated, and this section's own control failed to notice). If
//! this section goes red, the fix is almost never in this file — see `parser::many`'s module docs
//! for the reasoning the change would have to revisit.
//!
//! # Why every cell here runs twice, through two error types
//!
//! This is the half of #148 that was **never sink-dependent**. `Recover`, `InplaceRecover` and
//! `skip_then_retry` used to spend a trip only through a *discarding* error type — a delegating one
//! reported `is_terminal()` and was re-raised — which is why
//! `tokora/tests/pratt_limit_unit_sink.rs` pins those against their `LimErr` counterparts in
//! `tokora/tests/pratt_limit.rs`, one file per sink. Here the swallow arm consulted neither the
//! error's answer nor the input's, so it spent the trip from [`TripErr`] — which keeps the payload —
//! exactly as it did from `()`. Each family is therefore driven through both, in the same file, from
//! one macro body: the two must now agree, and the agreement is the property.
//!
//! [`TripErr`] deliberately does **not** implement
//! [`MaybeTerminal`](tokora::error::MaybeTerminal). That it compiles is itself an assertion: these
//! four gates witness terminality positionally and through the session, never through a trait bound
//! on the emitter's error type, and closing this hole did not change that.
//!
//! # Non-vacuity
//!
//! Through `()` a re-raised trip is `Err(())`, which carries no discriminant, so a fixture that
//! stopped reaching the ladder at all — a source that stopped lexing, an element that stopped being
//! called — reads exactly like the behaviour under test. Every cell therefore runs its probe a
//! second time with **only the recursion budget changed** and requires the same source to parse and
//! collect. `Verbose` is the emitter throughout rather than `Fatal`, for the same reason: a fatal
//! sink turns the swallow arm's own `emit_error` into an `Err` and would report a green cell over a
//! wide-open gate.
//!
//! # No scanner limiter anywhere in this file
//!
//! The lexer has no `State`, so no scan can trip and no poison boundary can ever be latched, which
//! pins `inp.at_committed_boundary()` to `false` for the whole run. The older witness therefore
//! cannot contribute to any verdict below: what these cells measure is the session latch alone.
//! `tokora/tests/collection_terminal_stop.rs` is the other side of that split — the same four
//! families under a *scanner* limiter and no descent at all.

      //
      // * the **scanner latch** is a fact about a token POSITION. A `CloseStatus::Close` verdict is
      //   cache-first, so it rests on a real pre-trip token: the construct ended ahead of whatever
      //   boundary the element's lookahead went on to latch, and that boundary is not about it.
      //   Gating a real close on the latch would fail a parse a wider scan window completes to the
      //   identical value, so the latch stays off this arm — `absence_terminal_stop.rs` is where
      //   that direction is pinned;
      // * the **descent trip** is a COUNTER EVENT inside the element attempt. A valid closer
      //   arriving afterwards does not unmake it. Before this, an element that caught a
      //   `RecursionLimitReached`, reported *no more elements*, and was then followed by a real
      //   closer produced a successfully closed collection that had silently spent a resource-limit
      //   stop — section 4's defect, through the arm section 4's gate deliberately does not cover.
      //
      // So these cells are section 4's with one character added to the source, and the arm they
      // reach carries the descent witness alone (`parser::many::close_after_element`).
      //
      // `separated().delimited()` gets ONE cell here, not two, and the missing one is a fact about
      // that driver rather than an omission. It probes the separator-or-close slot BEFORE it
      // attempts an element, so a closer sitting there is committed by that probe and the element
      // never runs; the epilogue sees a real closer only when the element attempt moved the front
      // onto it, which means the element CONSUMED. A consuming attempt cannot also be the
      // no-progress stall — the stall is defined by having committed nothing — so the stall exit of
      // that driver can only ever reach a close MISS, which section 4 already covers. The element
      // below therefore consumes and declines, the same shape `probe_close_no_rescan.rs` needs to
      // reach the same arm.
