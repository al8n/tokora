//! When the destination's capacity report reaches the emitter — and the three things that
//! answer depends on.
//!
//! In a collection driver the emitter is not a log. It is the thing that decides whether the
//! parse continues: `Ok(())` means *recovered, keep going*, `Err` means *stop now*. So **when**
//! `FullContainer` is emitted is also **when** a rejecting emitter gets to stop, and a report
//! withheld until the construct's end — which is what buys a deterministic
//! grammar-before-capacity order for a *recovering* emitter — costs a rejecting one three
//! separate things. Each cell below is one of them, and each was red before the report moved
//! back to the refusal:
//!
//! 1. `Fatal` is documented to stop at the first error. Withheld, it ran to the end of the
//!    construct first (nine element attempts over `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8`, not two).
//! 2. A refusal followed by any later `Err` exit lost the report entirely: the parse's error
//!    was the *later* failure and the witnessed refusal was never told.
//! 3. A destination that refuses at element 2 is an O(1) decision. Withheld, it became O(n)
//!    over trailing input the caller does not choose — 4099 element attempts against 4096
//!    trailing elements, versus 3 with none.
//!
//! `many::admit_element` states why the ordering the deferral bought cannot be bought back — and
//! how the ordering was reached instead, by settling the element's count bound one line ahead of
//! the push rather than by moving the capacity report. `end_state_parity.rs`'s case H and
//! `repetition_diagnostic_order.rs` record what both emitter classes see now.
