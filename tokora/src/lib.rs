/// - Positioned character iterators
/// - Message and knowledge types for error reporting

///
/// All errors carry span information for precise diagnostic reporting.

/// - Fixed-size arrays: Bounded lookahead with known maximum capacity
/// - Dynamic buffers: Unlimited lookahead (when `alloc` feature is enabled)
/// - Black hole cache: No caching for streaming-only scenarios
