// Deliberately no outer doc comment, unlike every other `pub mod` in this file. Rustdoc resolves

// in the crate: measured at 20 `unresolved link` errors plus 2 `redundant explicit link target`
// under `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"`, all for items that are right there in the module.
//
// The modules above get away with it because the names their headers link — `CstEmitter`,
// `Emitter`, `Window` — are re-exported at the crate root, so the root scope happens to resolve
// them. This module's are not, and should not be: `diagnostic::Severity` at the root would sit
// beside `emitter::Severity` for anyone doing a glob import. The alternative fix, spelling the
// header's links crate-absolute, trades an unresolved link for a redundant one and makes the
// correct spelling depend on the crate root's re-export set — so the module's own header keeps
// its own scope, and the crate index still shows its summary line from that header.
