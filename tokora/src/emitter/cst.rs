/// The CST event channel: an [`Emitter`] subtrait whose methods record the flat event stream
/// a lossless syntax tree is derived from (see [`cst::event`](crate::cst::event) for the
/// vocabulary and its laws).
///
/// # Why a subtrait, and not more defaulted methods on [`Emitter`]
///
/// Every other capability here is a diagnostic: a wrapper emitter that forgets to forward
/// `emit_warning` loses a warning — annoying, visible, recoverable. Tree events are load
/// bearing: a wrapper that forwards the diagnostic methods but not these would produce a
/// parse whose diagnostics flow perfectly and whose **tree is silently empty**. So the event
/// methods live on this separate trait, and CST-producing parse paths bound
/// `Ctx::Emitter: CstEmitter` — a non-forwarding wrapper is then a **compile error**, never a
/// silent empty tree. CST is the first capability that *binds* rather than defaults.
///
/// One token-shaped residue is out of the bound's reach: the auto-emission hook is the
/// defaulted [`Emitter::commit_token`] on the **core** trait (the consume surface must stay
/// callable without a CST bound), so a wrapper can forward this whole structuring surface
/// and still inherit the core no-op — structure flows, tokens vanish. The type system
/// cannot see a provided-method override, so that shape is caught at the other end: a
/// recording sink's `finish` **refuses** a balanced stream that builds structure without a
/// single committed token over a nonempty source
/// ([`StructureWithoutTokens`](crate::cst::CstFinishError::StructureWithoutTokens)) — a
/// typed error, never a plausible gap-tiled tree. A wrapper must forward
/// [`Emitter::commit_token`] alongside these methods.
///
/// # Defaulted no-ops: diagnostics-only emitters opt in trivially
///
/// Every method has an empty (or inert-value) default, so an emitter with no event channel
/// opts in with an empty `impl` — the crate does exactly that for [`Fatal`], [`Verbose`],
/// [`Silent`], and [`Ignored`](crate::utils::marker::Ignored). That is what makes *one*
/// parser assembly serve both configurations: over a plain diagnostics emitter the event
/// calls compile to nothing (reference-taking signatures, empty inlined bodies — the
/// zero-cost bar is byte-identical machine code, held by the `__text`-hash standard); over a
/// recording sink the same calls buffer the tree.
///
/// The recording implementation is the `rowan`-gated `CstSink`, which buffers events under
/// the one emitter checkpoint/rewind mark so backtracking rewinds the tree exactly as it
/// rewinds diagnostics.
///
/// # Contract: the raw surface is sharp
///
/// These are transport methods with the `enter_label`-class contract: route through the
/// blessed combinators (`node(kind, p)`-shaped bracketing,
/// [`Marker`](crate::cst::event::Marker) for retro-wraps) rather than calling the pair by
/// hand. A hand-rolled unbalanced [`cst_start`](Self::cst_start) /
/// [`cst_finish`](Self::cst_finish) is not detected at emit time — it is detected at the
/// sink's materialization, which refuses to build a wrong tree (typed error, never a panic).
/// Two shapes are worth naming:
///
/// - a **decline or error-unwind** between a start and its finish is safe *when the pair is
///   emitted by a both-exits bracket* (the `labelled` precedent); raw callers own that duty;
/// - a **session point rolled back across a finished node** truncates the finish but not the
///   start — legal, and reported by materialization as a leftover open, per the
///   `begin_point` settle-your-points clause.
