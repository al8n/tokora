/// A trait for handling and emitting errors during tokenization and parsing.
///
/// `Emitter` provides a unified interface for error handling in the tokenization pipeline.
/// Implementations can decide whether errors are fatal (stop processing) or non-fatal
/// (logged and processing continues). This is particularly useful when you want to collect
/// multiple errors before stopping, or when implementing error recovery.
///
/// # Atomically Composable Trait Design
///
/// Tokora's emitter system uses an **atomically composable trait design**. Instead of one monolithic
/// emitter interface, error handling is broken down into small, focused traits, each responsible for
/// a specific parsing scenario:
///
/// - **Core**: [`Emitter`] - Base error handling (lexer errors, unexpected tokens)
/// - **Repetition**: [`TooFewEmitter`], [`TooManyEmitter`], [`FullContainerEmitter`]
/// - **Separation**: [`SeparatedEmitter`], [`UnexpectedLeadingSeparatorEmitter`], [`UnexpectedTrailingSeparatorEmitter`]
///
/// This atomic design provides:
/// - ✅ **Fine-grained control**: Implement only the traits you need for your use case
/// - ✅ **Composability**: Mix and match traits to build custom error handling strategies
/// - ✅ **Pre-built bundles**: [`Fatal`], [`Verbose`], and [`Silent`] implement all traits with consistent behavior
/// - ✅ **Extensibility**: Create specialized emitters by implementing a subset of traits
///
/// Tokora provides several complete implementations: [`Fatal`], [`Verbose`],
/// [`Silent`], and [`Ignored`](crate::utils::marker::Ignored). However, the atomic trait system
/// encourages you to create custom emitters tailored to your specific needs by implementing only the
/// traits relevant to your parser.
///
/// # Error Handling Strategy
///
/// The emitter uses a `Result`-based approach where:
/// - `Ok(())` means the error was handled as non-fatal and processing should continue
/// - `Err(error)` means the error is fatal and processing should stop immediately
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// - **Error Collection**: Accumulate multiple errors before reporting them all at once
/// - **Error Recovery**: Log errors but continue parsing to find more issues
/// - **Fail-Fast**: Stop on the first error by always returning `Err`
/// - **Filtering**: Only treat certain error types as fatal
/// - **Custom Strategies**: Implement domain-specific error handling (e.g., max error limits, severity filtering, telemetry)
///
/// # Example: Custom Emitter with Error Limit
///
/// ```ignore
/// use tokora::emitter::{Emitter, TooFewEmitter, TooManyEmitter};

///     errors: Vec<String>,
