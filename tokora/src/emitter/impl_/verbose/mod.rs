/// A verbose emitter that collects all errors during parsing.
///
/// Unlike [`Fatal`](super::fatal::Fatal) which stops at the first error, or [`Silent`](super::silent::Silent)
/// which ignores errors silently, `Verbose` collects all errors encountered during parsing and
/// continues parsing where possible. This makes it ideal for compiler diagnostics, IDE integration,
/// and development scenarios where you need comprehensive error reporting.
///
/// `Verbose` is a **complete implementation** of all atomic emitter traits, providing a pre-built bundle
/// for comprehensive error collection. It implements:
/// - [`Emitter`](super::super::Emitter) - Core error handling
/// - [`TooFewEmitter`](super::super::TooFewEmitter) - "Too few elements" errors
/// - [`TooManyEmitter`](super::super::TooManyEmitter) - "Too many elements" errors
/// - [`SeparatedEmitter`](super::super::SeparatedEmitter) - Separator errors
/// - And other atomic traits for specific parsing scenarios
///
/// The errors are stored in a `BTreeMap` indexed by span, ensuring they are ordered by their
/// position in the source code. Multiple errors can share a single span (for example a
/// zero-width missing-element and missing-separator reported at the same offset), so each span
/// maps to a `Vec` of errors that accumulate in emission order rather than overwriting one
/// another. You can retrieve all collected errors via the [`errors()`](Self::errors) method.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```ignore
/// use tokora::emitter::Verbose;
///
/// // Create a verbose emitter
/// let emitter = Verbose::<MyError>::new();
///
/// // After parsing, retrieve all errors (each span may carry several).
/// for (span, errors) in emitter.errors() {
///     for error in errors {
///         println!("Error at {:?}: {}", span, error);
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// - **Compiler Diagnostics**: Collect all errors in a single pass to show users all issues at once
/// - **IDE Integration**: Provide comprehensive error highlighting and diagnostics
/// - **Development & Debugging**: Understand all parsing issues without having to fix them one at a time
/// - **Error Recovery**: Continue parsing after errors to provide better context and suggestions
///
/// # Comparison with Other Emitters
///
/// | Emitter | Behavior | Atomic Traits | Use Case |
/// |---------|----------|---------------|----------|
/// | [`Fatal`](super::fatal::Fatal) | Stop on first error | Implements all | Runtime, REPL, fail-fast scenarios |
/// | [`Silent`](super::silent::Silent) | Ignore all errors | Implements all | Error recovery, best-effort parsing |
/// | `Verbose` | Collect all errors | Implements all | Compilers, IDEs, comprehensive diagnostics |
/// | Custom | User-defined | Implement only what you need | Specialized use cases |
///
/// Thanks to Tokora's **atomically composable trait design**, you can implement only the emitter traits
/// your parser needs. `Verbose`, `Fatal`, and `Silent` are pre-built bundles that implement all atomic
/// traits with consistent behavior, but you're encouraged to create custom emitters by implementing just
/// the specific traits relevant to your parser.
///
/// # Diagnostic labels — context captured at emit time
///
/// [`labelled`](crate::labelled) opens a *"while parsing X"* context around a
/// sub-parse by pushing a `&'static str` onto this emitter's open-label stack
/// (via [`enter_label`](Emitter::enter_label)) and popping it as the scope closes.
/// Labels are captured **into the emission log at emit time**: each recorded
/// diagnostic carries a snapshot of the label stack that was open when it was
/// emitted, retrievable per-diagnostic through [`labels()`](Self::labels) in
/// lockstep with [`errors()`](Self::errors). Because the snapshot rides with the
/// entry, a [`rewind`](Emitter::rewind) that drops an entry drops its labels with
/// it, and a later re-emission re-derives its labels from the then-current stack;
/// the live stack itself follows the call structure of the wrapper scopes, so a
/// checkpoint restore needs no label handling at all.
///
/// # Two channels — errors and warnings
///
/// `Verbose` collects two parallel channels of diagnostics: hard [`errors()`](Self::errors)
/// (the [`Severity::Error`] tier, fed by the ordinary emit paths) and soft
/// [`warnings()`](Self::warnings) (the [`Severity::Warning`] tier, fed by
/// [`emit_warning`](Emitter::emit_warning)). Each channel keeps its own span-keyed groups and
/// its own parallel label snapshots ([`labels()`](Self::labels) /
/// [`warning_labels()`](Self::warning_labels)). A single emission `log` tags every entry with
/// its channel, so [`rewind`](Emitter::rewind) drops the abandoned branch's entries from the
/// correct channel and [`diagnostics()`](Self::diagnostics) can replay *both* channels
/// interleaved in true emission order.
///
/// # Skipped-region records — recovery holes
///
/// A third record kind rides the same log: [`emit_skipped_region`](Emitter::emit_skipped_region)
/// records the one-per-hole note of a balanced recovery skip
/// ([`sync_balanced`](crate::InputRef::sync_balanced)) — the hole's span and its skipped-token
/// count, read back through [`skipped_regions()`](Self::skipped_regions) with label snapshots
/// in [`skipped_region_labels()`](Self::skipped_region_labels). Sharing the log keeps rewind
/// exact — an abandoned branch's hole records unwind together with its diagnostics — and lets
/// [`diagnostics()`](Self::diagnostics) replay hole records interleaved with the payload
/// channels in emission order: each is yielded as a
/// [`DiagnosticKind::SkippedRegion`](crate::emitter::DiagnosticKind::SkippedRegion) carrying the
/// skipped-token count (its span and labels ride the [`Diagnostic`] as for any other record).
