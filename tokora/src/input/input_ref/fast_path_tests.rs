//! The hot no-op reads on the input surface, and the promise that taking them changes nothing.
//!
//! Two entry points answer without reaching the general machinery when the answer is already
//! sitting at the front of the token stream:
//!
//! * [`skip_while`](InputRef::skip_while) — the head is there and the predicate rejects it, so
//!   the scan would skip nothing: no scan scope, no frontier clone, no take-test-put-back of the
//!   stopping token, no commit of a position that did not move;
//! * [`peek_head_map`](InputRef::peek_head_map), and through it
//!   [`peek_kind`](InputRef::peek_kind) and [`head_satisfies`](InputRef::head_satisfies) — the
//!   head is there, so the window fill's slot arithmetic, its boundary probe, its overflow guard
//!   and its staging copy have nothing to do.
//!
//! A fast path is only worth anything if it is **indistinguishable**, so these tests never assert
//! that one was taken. They assert that it cannot be told apart from the path it bypasses, and
//! they do it by running the same program with the condition true and with it false:
//!
//! * **the condition** — a prefill puts the head in the cache (or, under a cache that retains
//!   nothing, a stop parks it), so the probe finds it;
//! * **its negation** — no prefill, so the cache is empty and the probe finds nothing; the
//!   general path runs and must land on the same observation.
//!
//! Every program runs at four prefill **widths** and under three cache capacities, and the whole
//! observable tuple — including **which tokens the predicate was asked about, in order** — must
//! agree across all twelve. A width, not a repetition count, and the residency each one achieves
//! is measured rather than assumed: `DefaultCache` is `U3`, so a sweep that issued `peek::<U3>`
//! `n` times reached the same residency for every `n > 0`, and the four depths it reported were
//! two states. Each capacity now asserts which residencies it reached — four, two and one
//! respectively. That last column is the one a naive `skip_while` fast path fails:
//! probing the head and then handing the same token to the scanner asks a stateful `FnMut` about
//! it twice, and a predicate that answers differently the second time would skip a token the
//! general path keeps or keep one it skips.
//!
//! The head read has its own pair of edges, and they pull in opposite directions: a resident head
//! must be served **even at a latched poison boundary** (the fill's own `want == 0` arm returns
//! before it probes the latch), and a head that is *not* resident must still raise the terminal
//! end-of-input error rather than the `Ok(None)` that means a genuine end of input. Both are
//! pinned below.
//!
//! [`peek_map`](InputRef::peek_map) is those same two edges one window wide, plus the third state a
//! head read cannot have — a window that came back **part** resident — and it is pinned in the same
//! place for that reason rather than because it has a fast path (it has none). What it does share
//! with the pair above is the thing that decides whether any of it is observable: the **emitter**.
//! A trip-truncated window and a genuinely short one are the same value, so only an emitter that
//! ACCEPTS the trip's diagnostic leaves a caller holding it — under a fatal one the parse is over
//! either way. Every cell there runs under `Verbose`, with one fatal cell beside them whose whole
//! job is to show that it cannot see the difference.
//!
//! # And what the observable tuple cannot see: the caller code each route runs
//!
//! Agreeing on every value a caller can read back is **not** the same as running the same code.
//! In a generic library the general routes also invoke caller-supplied `L::Span::clone`,
//! `L::State::clone`, `L::Offset::clone`, `Emitter::checkpoint`/`release` and `Cache` methods on
//! their way to the same answer, and a fast path that reaches the answer sooner runs fewer of
//! them. The second half of this file measures exactly that — an ordered **effect ledger** over an
//! instrumented lexer, emitter and cache — and pins both columns, because a claim about a
//! difference is only worth what its other side is worth.
//!
//! Measuring it is half the job. The other half is the **condition** under which running less
//! caller code is nevertheless invisible, and the last four cells build the callers who break it:
//! two whose predicate or closure reads the input layer, and two whose input-layer `Clone`
//! unwinds. The condition is written on the two methods as a property of the caller — *inert*
//! input-layer callbacks, and a predicate that is a *function of what it is handed* — rather than
//! as a list of the differences it excludes, so that satisfying it is something a caller checks
//! once about its own types instead of a list it has to keep up with.
//!
//! Neither comparison needs an ablation. `skip_while(|_| false)` over a resident head is precisely
//! `skip_until::<SkipWhile>` with a predicate that stops on the first token, and `peek_head_map`
//! over a resident head is precisely `peek::<U1>`'s `want == 0` arm — so both routes are reachable
//! from shipped code, over the same stream, in the same residency, with nothing varying but the
//! entry point.

// The caller-code effect ledger
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// The tests above pin what a caller can *observe about the input* — the tokens, the cursor, the
// committed span, the diagnostics. That is not the whole of what a fast path can change. In a
// generic library the general route also RUNS caller-supplied code on its way to the same answer:
// `L::Span::clone`, `L::State::clone`, `L::Offset::clone`, `Emitter::checkpoint`/`release`, and
// every `Cache` method. Those calls are effects in their own right — they can count, they can log,
// and they can panic.
//
// So this section instruments all of them and asks the direct question: **for the calls the fast
// paths answer, what caller code does each route run, and in what order?** The fixture below is a
// lexer, an emitter and a cache that record every such step into one ordered ledger, and the tests
// pin the ledger rather than describing it.
//
// The measured answer, and the contract it produces, is written on `skip_while` and on
// `peek_head_map`. In summary: for a no-op skip the fast path runs **no** caller clone and takes
// **no** emitter mark, where the general route runs one `L::Span::clone` + one `L::State::clone`
// under `Complete` and two of each plus a complete `checkpoint`/`release` pair under `Partial`.
// Every *value* those steps produce is the identity — which is why nothing above can see the
// difference — but the calls themselves are not made.

//
// !!! NOTHING BELOW IS SUPPORTED BEHAVIOUR. !!!
//
// Everything above measures a difference in WHICH caller code each route runs, and concludes that
// no *value* a caller can read back differs. That conclusion has a condition on it, stated on
// `skip_while` and on `peek_head_map` as two clauses about the caller rather than as a list of
// exclusions:
//
//   1. every caller-supplied operation the input layer can reach is INERT: it does only what its
//      own contract says it does, always returns, does not unwind, does not diverge. ALL of it —
//      the clause is a quantifier, not a set. The ones a caller is likely to have written are the
//      `Clone`, `Drop`, `Ord` and `Hash` of `L::Span` and `L::Offset`, the `Clone` and `Drop` of
//      `L::State`, the `Emitter` methods these paths reach, every `Cache` method, and the `Lexer`
//      with its `Source`; they are named for legibility and are explicitly NOT the boundary;
//   2. the caller's predicate or closure is a FUNCTION OF WHAT IT IS HANDED: it answers from the
//      *values* of the `Spanned<&L::Token, &L::Span>` it receives — not from state another
//      callback wrote, and not from the addresses those two references carry.
//
// The cells below are those two clauses made concrete: each builds a caller that fails one of
// them and shows that the failure is not a call count but a **different parse** — a different
// skip decision, a different committed cursor, different tokens consumed, a different returned
// value, or a different number of predicate calls surviving an unwind. They are instances, not an
// enumeration: a caller who breaks a clause in a way none of them describes is outside the
// guarantee just the same, and adding a cell here never narrows the clause.
//
// Clause 2 fails in the clone-counting, offset-counting and address-reading cells; clause 1 fails
// in the two unwinding ones and in the elided-drop one. The unwinding pair matters most, because
// their callers satisfy clause 2 in full: a predicate that records only its own calls observes no
// input-layer side effect at all, and still cannot be promised the same call sequence once a
// caller `Clone` panics.
//
// They exist so that the condition is a measured fact rather than a caveat nobody checked, and
// they pin a **documented precondition, not a behaviour**. No caller may rely on either column:
// which route answers a given call is this crate's choice and may change between versions, so the
// only thing a caller can do with the difference below is meet the condition. `Clone` is not
// required to be pure, total or non-unwinding in Rust, and `L::Span`, `L::State` and `L::Offset`
// are the caller's own types, which is exactly why the condition has to be written down instead
// of assumed.
//
// All of them are red against a build that runs the slow route: ablate either fast path and its
// two columns collapse onto each other, and the assertion that carries the finding fails.

///   once, deduplicated against a watermark that a prefill may already have raised. Which route
///   crossed it must not decide whether it is reported twice, or where the position lands
///   afterwards;
/// * **the fatal exit.** A rejecting emitter turns a diagnostic into the call's `Err`. Under the
///   scanner that exit keeps the scan's progress and settles the entry mark; on this route the
///   progress is already committed token by token and there is no mark. Both must leave the same
///   input behind.
///
/// The fixtures below arm the lexer (`!` runs lex as errors; a [`Budget`] makes it trip) and the
/// emitter (a rejection from the `n`-th diagnostic on), and the comparison is the same whole
/// [`SkipRun`] — including the latch and the dedup watermark, which only these cases can move.
///
/// This cell pins `FAULTY` two ways, and they catch different edits. `FAULTY_IDENTITIES`, right
/// below the fixture list, pins WHICH fixtures run — each one's exact source text and constructor
/// arguments — so a fixture swapped for a different one reds on that alone, whatever totals the
/// replacement happens to produce; the zero-budget trip and the trip behind a crossed lexer error
/// are each a single fixture below, with no sibling to cover for it if it were swapped out. The
/// exact seven-tuple after the sweep pins what the surviving identities actually reached, so an

/// not a fixture change — still reds there. Neither guard subsumes the other.
///

/// | drop the pre-lex `reached_boundary` probe in phase 2 | the same fixture with **two** skips: `span: (0, 3)` against `(2, 3)` — the second skip rebuilds a lexer at a latched boundary and commits a span that starts where the first one did |

/// **The committed-token side channel, over a parked front** — the cell
/// [`the_two_completeness_routes_observe_the_same_skip_over_a_parked_front`] says it cannot be.
///
/// That cell's own closing note is the specification for this one. [`SkipRun`] is the caller-visible
/// *values* a skip leaves behind, and [`Emitter::commit_token`](crate::Emitter::commit_token) is not
/// one of them: it is recorded by the ledger emitter as [`Effect::CommitToken`] and read back by no
/// cell in this file. Measured there: removing the notification from **both** sites a parked token's
/// consumption can reach — the complete-input settle (`settle_committed_token`) and the scanner's
/// `skip_and_report` — left every test in this file green, that cell included. A recording CST sink
/// would have lost a token with nothing red anywhere.
///
/// This closes it, on the residency that needs it most: a parked token is the one head the two
/// routes consume through **different** code — `front` + `commit_front` on the complete route, the
/// `Origin::Parked` fetch and `AtFrontier::adopt` on the scanned one — so it is the one head whose
/// notification could go missing on one route and not the other.
///
/// Three facts, and the middle one is the whole point:
///
/// * the **decline that parks** notifies nothing. `unconsume` is a put-back, not a settle, and
///   SETTLE_CENSUS lists it among the non-settles; this measures that rather than restating it;
/// * the **skip** notifies exactly once per token it consumed, on both routes;
/// * and the tokens it consumed are the right ones, so a route that fires the right count over the
///   wrong stream is still red.
///
/// Red against a deliberate breakage of **either** site, measured rather than asserted — each
/// removal made, this cell run, and the edit reverted:
///
/// | the notification removed from | what this cell reports |
/// |---|---|
/// | `settle_committed_token` (the complete route's settle) | `skipping: 0` against `1` — the complete route stops feeding the channel and the scanned one still does |
/// | `skip_and_report` (the scanned route's skip settle) | `skipping: 1` against `0` — the mirror image |
///
/// The second is the isolating one, and it is what makes the gap concrete: over that edit **every
/// other cell in this file stays green** (25 passed, 2 failed — this cell and
/// [`the_two_completeness_routes_observe_the_same_unwound_skip`], which reads the same channel).
/// The first is caught more widely, and saying so is more honest than claiming it is not:
/// `settle_committed_token` is every 1:1 consume settle in the crate, so removing it also reds
/// twenty cells in `cst::sink`, `input_ref::tests` and the census. Neither fact is a substitute for
/// the other — the parked-front path is reachable through both sites, and this cell is the only
/// thing in the file that watches either of them.
