//! Cache-capacity independence of a `to`-shaped scan stop and of every decline.
//!
//! The scanner's law is that *an unconsumed token lives at the front of the stream* — and the
//! promise it buys is that the cursor after a stop is the stopping token's start no matter who
//! lexed it. A cache that retains nothing (the blackhole `()`) is where that promise is
//! cheapest to break: every put-back is refused, so the token the scan decided not to consume
//! is simply gone, the cursor falls back to the committed position, and `is_eoi` answers a
//! different question than it does under a cache with room.
//!
//! These tests drive one program under three capacities — a three-slot deque, a one-slot
//! `Option`, and `()` — and require the whole observable tuple to be identical. `cache().len()`
//! is deliberately excluded: it is legitimately a function of the capacity. Everything else is
//! a function of the token stream.
//!
//! The fixture is [`BalLexer`] behind the by-value `TokenLimiter`, so the lexer-state tally is
//! part of the compared tuple: a capacity that drops a token and re-lexes it later shows up
//! there as well as in the positions.
