  /// With a **fatal** emitter that is invisible, because the trip's own diagnostic ends the parse
  /// either way. With a **non-fatal** emitter that accepts it, the caller is handed `Ok` with fewer
  /// tokens than it asked for and no way to ask why — a silently different parse rather than a
  /// stopped one.
  ///
  /// Two things can express it. [`peek_with_emitter_terminal`](Self::peek_with_emitter_terminal)
  /// reports it as a flag beside the window, for a caller that wants the short window *and* the
  /// reason; [`peek_map`](Self::peek_map) puts it in the error arm, reserving a short `Ok` window
  /// for a genuine end of input, which is what [`peek_head_map`](Self::peek_head_map),
  /// [`peek_kind`](Self::peek_kind) and [`head_satisfies`](Self::head_satisfies) do at the head.
  /// Prefer one of them wherever the window's *length* decides a production.
  ///
  /// # Stack footprint: one window, cache hit or miss
  ///
  /// The window this returns is the **only** `W::CAPACITY`-sized owned token storage a peek
  /// reserves, and its worst case is the whole array live at once:
  ///
  /// ```text
  /// W::CAPACITY × size_of::<Maybe<CachedToken<&Token, &State, &Span>,
  ///                              CachedToken<Token, State, Span>>>()
  /// ```
  ///
  /// which for every realistic type is `W::CAPACITY × (size_of::<Token>() + size_of::<State>() +
  /// size_of::<Span>())` plus per-entry padding and a discriminant. A **cache miss costs no
  /// second window**: tokens lexed past the cache are staged in this same buffer and rotated
  /// into place, so the miss path reserves exactly what the hit path does. (Through 0.7.3 the
  /// miss path staged them in a separate `W::CAPACITY`-slot array, doubling the figure above.)
  ///
  /// Everything else in the frame is **O(1) in the window width**: single-entry temporaries (one
  /// [`CachedToken`](crate::cache::CachedToken) in flight to the cache, the deque's own push and
  /// rotate temporaries), one clone of the lexer — `size_of::<L>()`, which contains `State` — and
  /// a small fixed part. Nothing here is heap-allocated, and nothing scales with the input.
  ///
  /// `Token` and `State` are unconstrained in size, so the bound is linear in both and in the

    // report: the cache region is copied out in one bulk read *after* the fill, while the
    // tokens past the cache are lexed *during* it. That ordering — not a shortage of room —

    // `buf`'s own tail and, once the cache region has been copied in behind them, rotating
    // them back to the end (see after the loop).
    //
    // Staging in `buf` rather than in a second `W::CAPACITY`-slot array is what holds the peek
    // frame to ONE window-sized store: `Token` and `State` are unconstrained in size, so a
    // second one doubles a peek's stack for a grammar that carries a large payload. It is also
    // why this function needs no partial-initialization bookkeeping: `buf` owns each staged
    // entry from the moment it is pushed, so every exit path — success, a withheld frontier, a
    // trip, or a failing return from a fatal emit — frees it exactly once through the deque's
    // own `Drop`.
    //
    // The copy is NOT reorderable ahead of the loop. `Cache::peek` takes `&'p self` and the
    // entries it appends borrow the cache for `'p`, the whole of the fill; the loop's every
    // step (`lex_within_boundary`, `classify`, `emit_lexer_error_deduped`, `cache_append`)
    // takes `&mut self`, and `cache_append` genuinely mutates the cache it would be aliasing.
    //
    // The staged region always fits. With `cap = buf.capacity()`, the fill is entered only with
    // `want = cap - buf_len - parked - in_cache` (the `saturating_sub` above returns early at
    // zero), and every token the loop produces decrements `want` and lands in either the cache
    // (`in_cache += 1`) or the staged region. So at every point
    // `buf_len + staged + parked + in_cache <= cap`, and the per-push assertion below pins the
    // same bound locally. Note what that accounting reserves: the cache region's room as much
    // as the staged region's, sized from `Cache::len()` before a single token is staged. A

  /// # Why a caller-facing check exists at all, and only here

  /// tokens lexed past the cache, and only then calls [`Cache::peek`](crate::cache::Cache::peek)
  /// into the room that is left. A `len` that is not the resident count mis-sizes that copy, and

  ///
  /// - an **under-report** clips the copy mid-run, and the rotation then closes the gap with
  ///   staged tokens that belong *after* the residents the clip dropped — not a short window, a
  ///   **HOLE**: the window reports a token at a position where the next consume serves a
  ///   different one. This failure is **created by the reordering** and is the reason this
  ///   function exists;
  /// - an **over-report** makes the fill reserve slots for residents that are not there and lex
  ///   too few tokens for them, so the window comes back **SHORT** while the input still has
  ///   more. That one is not new — it is what an over-reporting cache did before the reordering
  ///   too — but the count below sees it for free.
  ///
  /// The two early exits of the fill (the cache hit and the latched boundary) append nothing
  /// behind the copy, so neither can hole and neither is checked: they behave exactly as they
  /// did before the reordering, and adding a check there would put its cost on the width-1 head
  /// read a grammar runs per token.
  ///
  /// # Why the guards are shaped the way they are
  ///
  /// Every quantity a check is *gated* on is one the **fill** computes — `at`, `copied`,
  /// `staged` — never one the cache reports. `reserved` is a cache-derived value and appears

  /// decides whether a comparison runs. That is not a style preference, it is the correction of
  /// a real defect: an earlier revision of this check gated the endpoint witness on
  /// `reserved > 0`, and a cache under-reporting all the way to **zero** skipped the witness by
  /// that precondition while passing the count trivially as `0 == 0` — blindest exactly where
  /// the lie was largest. A precondition is an escape hatch unless it is itself verified.
  ///
  /// # The two halves, both in every build
  ///
  /// **THE COUNT** is a compare in every build. It catches the over-report direction outright,
  /// and it catches every under-report except the one that lands exactly on the window's edge.
  ///
  /// **THE ENDPOINTS** — the resident run's own witness, read from `front`/`back` rather than
  /// from `len`, so an inexact `len` cannot both cause the fault and hide it — is in every build
  /// too. It has to be, because it is the ONLY check that can see the two cases the count cannot:
  /// a clip whose `copied` happens to equal the reserved count, and an under-report all the way
  /// to zero, which satisfies the count trivially as `0 == 0`. Both of those are the **hole**, and
  /// a release build is where a downstream `Cache` runs.
  ///
  /// It was a `debug_assert!` for one release, on an instruction count that read the comparison —
  /// two ring indexes, a `Maybe` discriminant, an `Option<&Span>` compare — at 67–70 instructions
  /// retired per cache-miss fill. **That reasoning is retracted, and the retraction is measured.**
  /// The instruction count was never the price: the six peek-shaped bench ids read **0.9987**
  /// geometric mean with this witness release-active, every id inside 0.974×–1.009×, over ten
  /// interleaved criterion rounds on aarch64-apple-darwin.
  ///
  /// What the promotion *did* cost, before `#[inline(never)]` below, was the same thing
  /// PEEK_HOT_SPLIT found: the witness's code sitting in

  /// **1.025×**, consistently and outside the noise. Out of line it reads **1.003×**. An
  /// instruction count answers "what does this code cost where it runs"; the question that

  ///
  /// # Parameters
  ///
  /// - `at` — where the copy began: `buf.len()` immediately before `Cache::peek`.
  /// - `reserved` — the resident count the fill believes the cache has: `Cache::len()` read
  ///   before the fill, plus every token the fill then appended. Untrusted.
  /// - `staged` — how many tokens are waiting to be rotated in behind the copy, and the whole
  ///   reason this function is called: the fill reaches it only where `staged > 0`, because
  ///   that is exactly where a clipped copy becomes a hole rather than a short tail. Reported
  ///   in the message; not read as a gate, since the gate is the call site.

  /// ## What is guaranteed identical, and the condition that makes it so
  ///
  /// The same condition [`skip_while`](Self::skip_while) states applies here, and the difference
  /// it covers is much the smaller of the two: a peek commits nothing, so there is no frontier to
  /// clone and no mark to take on **either** route. What differs is confined to the cache surface
  /// and one offset read. Measured, on the same stream in the same residency, by the effect ledger
  /// in `fast_path_tests`:
  ///
  /// | caller-supplied step, for one width-1 read | this route | the general route |
  /// |---|---|---|
  /// | `Cache` | one `front` | one `len`, one `peek` — the fill's `want == 0` arm |
  /// | `L::Offset::clone` | 0 | 1 — the committed span's end, hoisted *here* above the fill |
  /// | `L::Span::clone`, `L::State::clone` | 0 | 0 |
  /// | `Emitter::checkpoint` / `release` / any emission | none | none |
  ///
  /// As on [`skip_while`](Self::skip_while), **that table is a measurement and not a boundary**:
  /// it holds the steps the ledger was built to watch, and the clause below is about every
  /// caller-supplied operation whether a table names it or not.
  ///
  /// ### What this route does differently — the whole of it
  ///
  /// Three clauses, meant as exhaustive. Against the general route, for every call it answers,
  /// this route:
  ///
  /// 1. **omits** caller-supplied steps and adds none. The hoisted `L::Offset::clone` is the one
  ///    the ledger sees; as with clause (1) on `skip_while`, *which* steps is not part of the
  ///    clause — it is a subset relation, not a list;
  /// 2. **substitutes** one [`Cache::front`](crate::cache::Cache::front) for the fill's
  ///    [`len`](crate::cache::Cache::len) + [`peek`](crate::cache::Cache::peek). All three are
  ///    `&self` reads the cache contract defines as changing no observable, so they are the same
  ///    read of the same head;
  /// 3. hands `f` the **same token and the same span**, once.
  ///
  /// ### The condition on the caller
  ///
  /// What follows holds for a caller who meets both clauses of the condition on
  /// [`skip_while`](Self::skip_while), read here with `f` in the predicate's place:
  ///
  /// * **your input-layer callbacks are inert** — every caller-supplied operation this crate can
  ///   reach through the input layer does only what its own contract says, and always returns
  ///   normally: no unwind, no divergence. *All of it, not a list.* Likely to be yours: the
  ///   `Clone`, `Drop`, `Ord` and `Hash` of `L::Offset` and `L::Span`, the `Clone` and `Drop` of
  ///   `L::State`, every [`Cache`](crate::cache::Cache) method, the [`Emitter`](crate::Emitter),
  ///   the [`Lexer`](crate::Lexer) and its [`Source`](crate::Source) — named as the ones you are
  ///   likely to write, not as the edge of the clause;
  /// * **`f` is a function of what it is handed** — it answers from the *values* of the
  ///   `Spanned<&L::Token, &L::Span>` it receives, not from state another callback wrote and not
  ///   from the addresses those references carry.
  ///
  /// The closure argument is the same one, and it is why this is a condition rather than a list:
  /// the three clauses above say the crate hands `f` the same values, so any difference must come
  /// from caller-supplied code; the first clause makes all of that code invisible whether it runs
  /// or not, and the second stops `f` reading which route produced its argument. `F: FnOnce(..)
  /// -> O` may capture whatever it likes and `L::Offset` is *your* type, so neither clause is a
  /// formality — but both are properties of your own types, checkable once.
  ///
  /// ### For such a caller, guaranteed identical
  ///
  /// The value handed to `f`, and therefore the value returned; that `f` runs exactly once; that
  /// nothing is consumed, committed, emitted or latched; that a resident head is served at a
  /// latched poison boundary and a non-resident one still raises the terminal end-of-input error.
  ///
  /// ### And for a caller who does not meet it
  ///
  /// Both of these are one clause failing, and both are measured. Neither is the list of ways to
  /// fail — a caller who breaks a clause some other way gets the same answer:
  ///
  /// * **an `f` that reads the input layer** — the second clause. The offset row above is the
  ///   whole mechanism: the general route takes `self.span().end()` before the fill, for a
  ///   terminal end-of-input error a resident head makes unreachable, and this route does not, so
  ///   the returned `O` differs between them. An `O` that differs is a parse that differs —
  ///   [`head_satisfies`](Self::head_satisfies) and [`peek_kind`](Self::peek_kind) ride this call,
  ///   so the value in question is routinely a grammar decision.
  ///   (`an_offset_clone_counting_f_can_change_the_value_peek_head_map_returns`)
  /// * **an `L::Offset::clone` that unwinds** — the first clause, and again the sharper case,
  ///   because such a caller's `f` may observe nothing whatsoever. That hoisted clone is the
  ///   general route's *first* caller step: arm it to panic and the general route unwinds before
  ///   `f`, where this route never reads the offset and returns `Ok(Some(_))` with `f` run once.
  ///   Whether `f` ran at all is then decided by which route answered.
  ///   (`an_unwinding_offset_clone_decides_whether_peek_head_maps_closure_runs_at_all`)
  ///
  /// An `f` whose answer — or whose *reachability* — depends on **how the input layer got the head
  /// to it** is not asking about the head; it is asking which route this crate took, and that is a
  /// choice this crate makes and may change in any release. Answer out of the
  /// `Spanned<&L::Token, &L::Span>` you were handed, from types that clone by copying, and both
  /// clauses hold by construction — as they do for every `f` in this crate, its tests and its
  /// examples.
