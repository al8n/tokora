///
/// That is also why the pair is two types rather than one.
/// [`ScannerTripBaseline`] must stay [`Copy`]: the collection drivers read their baseline more than

///
/// **The control first**, because a `compile_fail` that fails for the wrong reason proves nothing.

  ///   it is refused for the life of the input;
  /// - the **poison boundary**, positionally, at the committed cursor — the lexer's own limit trip,
  ///   which lives in `L::State` and therefore travels with the regime that produced it.
  ///
  /// Reading the boundary *live* rather than against a baseline is the whole of why this can be
  /// published where the session's scanner-trip counter cannot.
  /// [`set_state`](Self::set_state) / [`state_mut`](Self::state_mut) drop the boundary, and

  /// recovered with `set_state`, all eight consumed and the witness still `true`. This reading goes
  /// `false` the moment the regime that owned the stop dies, because there is nothing left to read.
  ///
  /// For the same reason it needs no baseline at any nesting depth. A witness that *compares* a

  /// to; this one is not a comparison, so there is no placement of a baseline for a caller to get
  /// wrong.
  ///
  /// # A ROLLBACK restores the record, and it restores it in both directions
  ///
  /// [`try_attempt`](Self::try_attempt), [`attempt_parse`](Self::attempt_parse), a rollback-on-drop

  /// [`Checkpoint`](crate::input::Checkpoint)'s saved cursor, saved lexer state **and** saved
  /// boundary. A checkpoint taken *after* a trip puts a live stop back and this reports it. A
  /// checkpoint taken *before* one — which is every speculative wrapper's own begin point — puts a
  /// `None` boundary back at a rewound cursor, so an attempt that tripped inside propagates the
  /// rejecting emitter's ordinary-looking `Err` with nothing left on the input to read, and this
  /// answers `false`.
  ///
  /// **That `false` is not wrong about the input — it is the wrong question for the caller.** The

  /// because an abandoned speculation's tokens are not in the committed stream. So after that
  /// rollback a scan from the restored cursor really does yield a token, and this reading says so
  /// correctly. What the caller has lost is not the state of the input but the **history of the
  /// attempt**: the wrapper's next turn re-derives the identical trip, and a root loop reading only
  /// this one files a report every turn without ever advancing the cursor.
  ///
  /// A loop that keeps redoing refundable work is detected by
  /// [`scanner_outcome`](Self::scanner_outcome)'s
  /// [`Stalled`](crate::input::ScannerOutcome::Stalled) arm — a trip after which none of the
  /// determinism clause's three inputs moved — and bounded by putting the budget on the input. What *this* method does not answer,
  /// and [`scanner_stopped_during_attempt`](Self::scanner_stopped_during_attempt) does, is the
  /// other residue in this list: a stop latched **ahead** of the committed cursor by a lookahead,
  /// which every positional reading — this one included — is blind to. **This method stays the
  /// narrow live query**: is a stop on record *here*, now.
  ///
  /// One bound belongs on neither of them but on the caller's choice of where to put it. A
  /// [`TokenBudget`](crate::input::TokenBudget) on the **input** is outside every

  /// clause names it as a contract violation, and the input layer's behaviour under one is

  /// # The shape the guards cannot express
  ///
  /// Every guard ([`begin`](Self::begin), [`begin_stacked`](Self::begin_stacked)) and both

  /// REPL, an IDE that parses a fragment, speculates, and decides on a later call — cannot hold a
  /// guard beside the input it borrows: that value would be self-referential.
  ///
  /// A session point is a **value on the input**, not a borrow of it. `begin_point` takes
  /// `&mut self`, pushes, and returns; the borrow ends with the call, so the whole consume surface
  /// ([`next`](Self::next), [`peek`](Self::peek), [`try_expect`](Self::try_expect), any parser you
  /// hand this input to) stays callable *with the point still open*, in this call and in later
  /// ones:
  ///
  /// ```ignore
  /// let p = inp.begin_point();  // mark — nothing is borrowed afterwards
  /// let t = inp.next()?;        // parse, in this call or a later one
  /// let u = inp.next()?;        // …and again
  /// inp.rollback_point(p);      // unmark: cursor, span, state, cache, diagnostics all return
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Settle the point with [`commit_point`](Self::commit_point) (keep the progress) or
  /// [`rollback_point`](Self::rollback_point) (return to it), naming it by the
  /// [`SessionPointId`] this returns. The stack *is* the last-in, first-out order — points settle
  /// newest-first — so nesting stays structural; the id is what stops a settle from naming a
  /// *shifted* target, and what makes a stale one a refusal rather than a silent settle of
  /// whatever happens to be newest. [`points`](Self::points) is the live depth.
  ///
  /// # A point pins its base
  ///
  /// A session point is the base of a speculative scope, so it carries the same hazard a guard
  /// base does until it is settled: a rewind reaching *below* it would tear its foundation out.
  /// Two ways to reach it, both caller bugs, and each answered where it can be:
  ///
  /// - a **checked** rewind below the point — a raw [`restore`](Self::restore) (reachable only
  ///   under `unstable-raw`) or [`Transaction::rollback`](Transaction::rollback) — is refused
  ///   outright: the pin makes it **panic where it is requested** rather than corrupt the
  ///   timeline silently;
  /// - a **reconciling** rewind cannot refuse anything, so it abandons instead: every point
  ///   younger than its base is unpinned, its lineage entry dropped and its emitter mark
  ///   released — before the rewind, exactly as dropping the handle abandons a point still open.
  ///   The point's progress is not rolled back separately; the rewind subsumes it. Two shapes
  ///   reach it: a guard's or an attempt's **rollback on drop**, which *may not* refuse (a `Drop`
  ///   may run while already unwinding, where panicking is forbidden), and the explicit
  ///   [`Transaction::rollback_abandoning_points`](Transaction::rollback_abandoning_points),
  ///   which *chooses* not to.
  ///
  /// Those are the two *answers*, and which one a given rollback should be is a question about
  /// **who owns the points** — that verb's docs answer it. A scope that owns every point opened
  /// inside it keeps the refusal, because there a point still open above the base means the code
  /// that opened it lost track of its own speculation. A scope spanning foreign code does not:
  /// [`attempt`](Self::attempt), [`try_attempt`](Self::try_attempt) and
  /// [`attempt_parse`](Self::attempt_parse) hand a whole handle to a caller-supplied closure, and
  /// the typed pratt driver hands one to grammar hooks, so **all** of their explicit rollbacks
  /// reconcile — matching what their own unwind edge has always done. Abandoning is a liberty
  /// this method grants (see the drop section below); a rollback that answered it with a release
  /// panic would be re-classifying that liberty as a bug from the wrong side of the seam.
  ///
  /// Settle your points before the scope that opened them ends and neither arises. What never
  /// happens either way is the third outcome: a point left on the stack describing a lineage the
  /// rewind destroyed.
  ///
  /// One thing a point deliberately **cannot** reach is the interior of a
  /// [`node`](crate::parser::node) bracket a caller is already inside: settling a point from an
  /// enclosing frame there would rewind below that bracket's start and stale the mark its failing
  /// exit must spend, so the invariant `'closure` brand on the id refuses it at compile time —
  /// the wall is the brand, not a runtime check. See *A rollback below the start cannot happen
  /// mid-frame* in the [`node` module docs](crate::parser::node).
  ///
  /// # Contract: a point is scoped to *this handle*, and never outlives it
  ///
  /// A session point is non-lexical — it outlives the *call* that opened it — but it is **not**
  /// unbounded: it lives on this `InputRef` and dies with it. It cannot be carried to another
  /// handle, not even one taken from the same input, and this is a *law*, not a convention.
  ///
  /// The reason is what a [`Checkpoint`] carries. Among its facts is the **emitter's emission
  /// mark** — an index into the log of *the emitter this handle borrows*
  /// ([`Emitter::checkpoint`](crate::emitter::Emitter::checkpoint)), which
  /// [`rollback_point`](Self::rollback_point) replays into
  /// [`Emitter::rewind`](crate::emitter::Emitter::rewind). A point saved while emitter *A* was
  /// borrowed and settled while emitter *B* is would truncate *B*'s log at *A*'s mark: a diagnostic
  /// count from one timeline, applied to another. So a checkpoint is only meaningful within the one
  /// emitter borrow that produced it, and a session point — a checkpoint held across calls — must be
  /// scoped to that borrow.
  ///
  /// That scope *is* this handle: `as_ref` takes the emitter borrow, the handle holds it, and the
  /// borrow ends when the handle dies. The type system enforces it — the `'closure` brand on
  /// [`Checkpoint`] (and [`Cursor`]) is invariant in the emitter-borrow lifetime, so a checkpoint
  /// cannot even be *held* across the moment a second handle is taken from the same input; the
  /// attempt is a borrow error, not a runtime surprise. The point stack is therefore a field of the
  /// handle rather than of the input, on purpose.
  ///
  /// # Dropping the handle with points open: pins released, progress kept, nothing rewound
  ///
  /// Unlike a guard — whose drop rolls back (or, under [`Commit`], keeps) its undecided scope —
  /// dropping the handle with live session points performs **no rollback**. Their speculative work
  /// is *kept*: every token consumed, every diagnostic emitted, and every state change made through
  /// an open point stands, exactly as if each had been committed. A session ends *explicitly*;
  /// rolling an abandoned one back implicitly would silently paper over a driver that lost track of
  /// its own points — the deliberate opposite of a guard's drop policy — so the end is left explicit
  /// to surface that bug instead.
  ///
  /// # It is not merely the chosen policy — it is the only buildable one
  ///
  /// The deferral that carried this to the end of the campaign was framed as a *policy
  /// decision* between commit, rollback and a hybrid. Two of those three are not available from
  /// this drop site, which turns the decision into a structural fact plus a naming duty.
  ///
  /// `Session::drop` holds the lineage and the emitter, so it can release marks and pins. It
  /// does **not** hold the input itself: it cannot restore the span, the
  /// lexer state or the cursor. So "rollback on abandon" is not a posture this crate declined
  /// to take — it is unwritable from here. The one thing that *is* buildable, rewinding the
  /// emitter while keeping the position, is the **hybrid restore** the crate already refuses
  /// elsewhere, because a position without its matching emissions is the torn state the whole
  /// settle discipline exists to prevent.
  ///
  /// A `debug_assert!(points.is_empty())` on drop is also rejected, and for a reason worth
  /// stating rather than leaving as taste: abandonment via `?` through an enclosing rollback is
  /// a **legal** history, and an assert that fires on legal histories is exactly the class this
  /// crate has spent the campaign narrowing.
  ///
  /// So: an abandoned session point commits. Handle death keeps committed progress and releases
  /// the point's mark; a point you need rolled back must be settled by
  /// [`rollback_point`](Self::rollback_point) **before** the handle dies, because the drop site
  /// cannot reach the input to restore it. (Same argument family as "`Checkpoint` deliberately
  /// has no `Drop`".)
  ///
  /// What the drop *does* do is **release the bookkeeping**: each remaining point's pin and its
  /// live-checkpoint lineage entry are dropped from the input's lineage memos, and its emitter
  /// mark is [`release`](crate::emitter::Emitter::release)d (see the session cell's `Drop` in
  /// `input_ref::session`).
  /// It has to, precisely because the point is split across lifetimes — the [`Checkpoint`] dies
  /// with the handle, but the pin lives on the *input* and the mark-keyed bookkeeping in the
  /// *emitter*, and both outlive it. A pin left behind would stand for a point nobody can ever
  /// settle, so the pin set would no longer hold exactly the live begin points and would grow for
  /// the life of the input — and a mark never released would strand one row of an event sink's
  /// checkpoint stack per abandoned point, the same leak one layer up. Enforcing tests:
  /// `dropping_the_handle_releases_the_open_points`,

  /// compiled out entirely in release, where it costs nothing.

  /// Release builds do not check. An out-of-order restore leaves the input in an

  /// no undefined behavior, no leak, no panic originating in the **input layer**, every scan
  /// terminates (the resource-limiter state travels inside the checkpoint, so a

  ///
  /// What is **not** guaranteed after a violation: diagnostics may be missing or
  /// attributed to the wrong branch, and the replayed token stream may differ from
  /// what was visible at the save. The only well-specified use of a checkpoint is
  /// restoring it while it is still valid.
  ///
  /// **The attached emitter keeps its own posture, and one of them is louder than this.** The
  /// no-panic clause above is the input layer speaking for itself; a violation still reaches
  /// [`Emitter::rewind`], and an emitter that can *detect* the resulting unpaired settle is

  /// - an **honest** lexer can legitimately report below its span end. A span is half-open, so an
  ///   item decided purely from its own bytes — a fixed token with no rule continuing past it,
  ///   needing no terminator probe — truthfully reports `span.end - 1`, the offset of its own last
  ///   byte. Demanding `>= span.end` of implementors would make the crate's own convention a
  ///   contract violation. [`Lexer::read_frontier`] states the relation this way, and this comment
  ///   must not restate it as a duty;
  /// - a **buggy** lexer's `ReadTo(0)` would, unfloored, yield an item the pre-0.10.0 holdback
  ///   withheld — a regression introduced by the fix.
  ///
  /// One comparison answers both: `effective = max(span.end, reported)` makes monotonicity a
  /// property of this function rather than of the ecosystem, so an under-report costs precision
  /// and never soundness. It is the same posture the crate already takes on the post-exhaustion
  /// span, where the frontier reader "floors and clamps as defence in depth against a
  /// non-conforming lexer; that clamp is not the specification".
  ///
  /// Over-reporting only over-withholds, and that converges: a refill strictly grows the buffer
  /// and sealing ends the game, so no livelock.
  ///
  /// # It reports the BUFFER END, not the span end
  ///
  /// Those coincided under the old predicate and the tests asserted the coincidence; under this
  /// one they diverge — span end 1, frontier 3. [`Incomplete`](crate::error::Incomplete)'s offset
  /// is documented as "the frontier the caller should resume from", and reporting the span end
  /// would claim the input ran out at 1, which is false. A withheld item has an effective frontier
  /// at or past `len` and no probe can exceed `len`, so the honest answer is exactly
