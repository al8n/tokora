  /// # Dropping the handle with points open: pins released, progress kept, nothing rewound
  ///
  /// Unlike a guard — whose drop rolls back (or, under [`Commit`], keeps) its undecided scope —
  /// dropping the handle with live session points performs **no rollback**. Their speculative work
  /// is *kept*: every token consumed, every diagnostic emitted, and every state change made through
  /// an open point stands, exactly as if each had been committed. A session ends *explicitly*;
