/// A scoped backtracking transaction over an [`InputRef`].
///
/// Semantically identical to [`save`](InputRef::save)/[`restore`](InputRef::restore),
/// with the restore discipline enforced by the borrow checker: while a nested
/// transaction is alive, its parent is inaccessible, so out-of-order rollbacks — the
/// one contract violation [`restore`](InputRef::restore) documents — do not compile.
/// Nested transactions behave like database savepoints: rolling back a parent discards
/// everything its children committed.
///
/// [`commit`](Self::commit) and [`rollback`](Self::rollback) both consume the
/// transaction and are available whatever the policy. Zero-cost:
/// [`begin`](InputRef::begin) performs exactly one [`save`](InputRef::save), the guard
/// is two words, and deciding is one branch — there is no journaling, because the input
/// source is immutable and rewinding is a snapshot copy.
///
/// # Drop policy
///
/// The final type parameter `P` is a compile-time [`DropPolicy`](super::DropPolicy) that
/// fixes what an *undecided* guard does on drop:
///
/// - [`Rollback`](super::Rollback) (the default, from [`begin`](InputRef::begin)) — drop
///   restores to the begin point; uncommitted speculative work is discarded.
/// - [`Commit`](super::Commit) (from [`begin_with`](InputRef::begin_with)) — drop keeps
///   the progress, the dual used by commit-by-default loops.
///
/// # When to reach for it
///
/// Use `Transaction` for imperative flows with several exits (loops, `match` arms) —
/// [`begin`](InputRef::begin) for the speculative default, or
/// [`begin_with::<Commit>`](InputRef::begin_with) for a commit-by-default loop that keeps
/// progress on most exits and rolls back explicitly on the few that back out. Reach for
/// [`attempt`](InputRef::attempt)/[`try_attempt`](InputRef::try_attempt) for
/// single-closure speculation. Raw [`save`](InputRef::save)/[`restore`](InputRef::restore) sit
/// beneath all of these as the `unstable-raw` escape hatch, reachable only with that feature and
/// only where no guard shape fits.
///
/// The guards fit lexical scopes; for owned, externally-driven speculation — a driver that owns
/// its input and is stepped across separate calls — reach for
/// the [session points](crate::InputRef::begin_point); raw checkpoints sit beneath both.
///
/// # Compile-time last-in, first-out
///
/// A nested transaction mutably borrows its parent for as long as it is alive, so the
/// non-LIFO shape — deciding a parent while a child is still undecided — is a borrow
/// error, not a runtime panic:
///
/// ```compile_fail
/// use tokora::{InputRef, Lexer, ParseContext};
///
/// fn non_lifo<'inp, 'closure, L, Ctx>(input: &mut InputRef<'inp, 'closure, L, Ctx>)
/// where
///   L: Lexer<'inp>,
///   L::State: Clone,
///   Ctx: ParseContext<'inp, L>,
/// {
///   let mut outer = input.begin();
///   let mut inner = outer.begin();
///   outer.rollback(); // error: `outer` is mutably borrowed by `inner`
///   inner.commit();
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Mixing with raw save/restore
///
/// The guard deref-coerces to [`InputRef`], so raw [`save`](InputRef::save) /
/// [`restore`](InputRef::restore) are reachable through it. A raw restore to a checkpoint saved
/// *before* the guard began would roll the lineage back past the guard's own begin-point
/// checkpoint, tearing out the region the guard borrows from its begin point forward. In
/// allocator builds the guard **pins** its begin point, so such a restore **panics at the
/// restore itself** (`restore would invalidate a live transaction guard or attempt …`) — the
/// violation is refused where it is caused, before any commit/rollback decision. A LIFO-clean
/// raw save/restore pair taken and released entirely *above* the begin point, and state surgery
/// (which is transactional), leave the guard's checkpoint intact and never trip the pin. Such a
/// raw checkpoint should itself end in [`restore`](InputRef::restore) or
/// [`commit`](InputRef::commit) — dropping it strands its lineage entry, exactly as in
/// standalone raw use.
///
/// On allocator-less targets there is no pin set and no lineage stack, so this mixing is
/// unspecified-but-bounded rather than checked. In allocator builds the older detect-at-use
/// behaviors remain as backstops behind the pin check — an explicit [`rollback`](Self::rollback)
/// still asserts a live base, a rolling-back drop still skips a stale one — defense in depth that
/// the pin check now makes unreachable in ordinary use.
///
/// This entire mixing surface exists only with the `unstable-raw` feature. Without it, raw
/// [`save`](InputRef::save) / [`restore`](InputRef::restore) are crate-internal, so a downstream
/// crate cannot express a raw restore beneath a live guard at all — the hazard is unrepresentable
/// there, and the guard is the whole story.
