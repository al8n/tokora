  /// be consumed but must never surface as an error.

  /// # The token that stops the skip is left at the cache front
  ///
  /// A token this call examined but did not consume is **unconsumed**: it is put back at the front
  /// of the peek cache — where [`try_expect`](Self::try_expect) puts the token its predicate
  /// declined, and the one place [`cursor`](Self::cursor) reads. So the resume cursor after a skip
  /// is the stopping token's start, whether that token had been peeked into the cache beforehand or
  /// this call lexed it a moment ago, and the next read serves it without re-lexing. The cache is
  /// an invisible optimization here as everywhere: nothing a caller can observe about a
  /// `skip_while` — the committed span and lexer state, the cursor, the diagnostics, the poison
  /// boundary, the dedup watermark, the tokens read next — depends on how deep it had peeked. The
  /// `cache_transparency_matrix` tests in `src/input/input_ref/tests.rs` pin that across this
  /// method and `padded`.
