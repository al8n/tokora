//! SETTLE_CENSUS / RELEASE_CENSUS / CAPTURE_WINDOW / RESUME_CENSUS / FRONT_CENSUS — the source
//! censuses of every place a committed token settles, every place an emitter checkpoint is spent
//! or forgotten, every place one is taken behind the preflight reservation that keeps an unwind
//! from stranding it, every place the (state, offset) pair a fresh lexer resumes from is built,
//! and every place the front of the token stream is reached.
//!
//! # Why a census, and why here
//!
//! A token becomes *committed* at a handful of settle sites spread across the consume
//! surface: the `next` arms, the `consume_cached` family, the `try_expect` accept arms,
//! the shared scanner's skip/stop settles. Any side channel that must observe committed
//! tokens exactly once (a CST event stream riding the emitter, a lossless trivia view)
//! has to hook **all** of them — an invariant enforced at N call sites instead of one
//! chokepoint, with N ≈ a dozen on day one. The crate's answer is the same as everywhere
//! else: one primitive ([`InputRef::commit_token`](super::InputRef)), every consume
//! settle routed through it, and a census that fails the build the moment a settle
//! appears outside it.
//!
//! Rust has no call-site reflection, so — exactly like `OP_SURFACE_CENSUS` in
//! `src/fuzz/ops.rs` — the residual "notice a new site exists" step is anchored by a
//! greppable marker and a consciously-maintained count. These tests are that count: they
//! read the `input_ref` sources with `include_str!` and assert the exact number of
//! settle-surface calls per file. Adding a consume path without routing it through the
//! primitive moves a count and fails a named test whose message carries the checklist.
//! `grep SETTLE_CENSUS` finds every anchor.
//!
//! # The census (what must stay true)
//!
//! **Every 1:1 consume settle goes through `commit_token`** — the nineteen sites:
//! `next()`'s and `next_or_stop()`'s cached and fresh-lex arms (4), `consume_cached_one` and
//! `consume_cached_to`'s loop body (2 — `consume_all_cached` drains *through*
//! `consume_cached_to`, per token), the `try_expect`/`try_expect_map`/
//! `try_expect_and_then`/`try_expect_or_stop`/`try_expect_map_or_stop` cached and accept
//! arms (10), the by-value `commit_probed` settle of a probed closer (1),
//! `SyncThrough::on_stop` (1), and the complete-input trivia skip's lexing phase (1).
//!
//! …**through one of its two entrances.** The body is a fallible clamp followed by an infallible
//! `settle_committed_token`, and the split is load-bearing: `commit_token` is handed a token its
//! caller already removed, so its clamp runs in the window where the token is out of the stream
//! and the position has not moved. `commit_front` is the other entrance, for a caller that removes
//! the token itself and can therefore clamp *first* — the trivia skip's resident phase, which
//! crosses a run of tokens rather than one and closes that window by order instead of by a scope.
//! Both entrances reach the side channel through the one infallible half, so the emitter hook
//! still has a single home, and the census locks the half to exactly those two callers.
//!
//! **The one skip settle is `AtFrontier::adopt`**, called only by `skip_and_report`: a
//! token a scan skips settles behind the frontier — not into the input's span — exactly
//! once, whichever origin fed it. It is the settle surface's second (and last) member.
//!
//! **The span funnel is not a settle.** `set_span_after_consume` is also written by
//! four non-token paths, and they must **never** grow a settle hook: `settle_fatal`
//! writes a *rejected lexer error's* span; `SyncTo::on_eof` and the complete-input trivia skip's
//! own end-of-input arm write the lexer's span at exhaustion; `commit_at` batch-writes a whole
//! skipped run's frontier (each skipped token already settled via `adopt`). Peeks, declines, `unconsume`/`hold_front`, the
//! front fetches (`take_front`, `take_front_if`), the peek fill's back push
//! (`cache_append`), and the position-write surgeries (`set_state`, restores) touch no
//! settle at all — a fetch is not a commit, and every caller of one still calls
//! `commit_token` itself.
//!
//! **The front of the stream has five primitives** (FRONT_CENSUS): `front`, `has_front`,
//! `take_front`, `take_front_if`, and `hold_front`. Every consume, peek, probe, put-back
//! and position read reaches the front through them, never through `Ctx::Cache` directly
//! — a path that talks to the cache sees a zero-capacity one as empty and re-lexes a token
//! that is parked right there. The `self.pending` counts the census pins per file are the
//! checklist: `mod.rs` 16 (the five primitives and the three cold parked halves they gate
//! into, the `park` write and the head guard above it, `resume` and its cold parked arm,
//! `cursor`, `offset`, the re-key, the restore), `peek/mod.rs` 4 (one accounting read and
//! the three window exits), `scan.rs` 1 (the fetch's origin probe), everywhere else 0.
//!
//! **Every hot-path probe of the slot is gated on `Cache::RETAINS_FRONT`**, through
//! `InputRef::can_park()`. Only a cache that can *refuse* a front push into an empty cache
//! ever parks anything, so under a retaining cache the slot is statically `None` and the
//! probe folds away at monomorphization. The gate counts are censused beside the slot
//! counts — `mod.rs` 8, `peek/mod.rs` 4, `scan.rs` 1 — so a new reader of the slot has to
//! decide its gating rather than inherit an ungated probe; the touches that are
//! deliberately ungated are the cold ones (the parked halves reached through a gate, the
//! `park` write, and the two drops in the re-key and the restore).
//!
//! Counting is line-based and skips `//`-prefixed lines, so doc references to these
//! names do not count; only code does. Keep code mentions of the counted names off
//! comment-trailing positions and out of string literals in these files.

//   five committing exits of `skip_until` (boundary drain, fatal lex propagation, trip,
//   stop, fatal report propagation); the sixth exit is `on_eof`, which spends the mark
//   by rewinding to it.

// where the fallible step is a caller-supplied clone rather than a container push — hoist that
// clone above the capture instead. Either way, once the capture is taken, its landing is either
// already-reserved capacity or has nothing fallible left ahead of it. Eight sites close a window
// this way:
//
// - `guard_with` (so `begin`/`begin_with` and both attempts) and `begin_stacked_with` each pin
//   their captured begin point into the lineage's pin stack — a SECOND container, distinct from
//   the one `save` itself reserves — via `reserve_pin_slot`, called before `save`;
// - `begin_point` does the same, and ALSO lands its capture on the session's own point stack,
//   reserved via `session.points.reserve(1)`, likewise before `save`;
// - `save_checkpoint` — the shared body every `save` funnels through — reserves the
//   live-checkpoint stack's slot with `reserve_open` before EITHER of its own two registrations
//   (the emitter mark, then the lineage entry that follows it);
// - `StackedTransaction::savepoint` reserves its slot in the savepoint stack before capturing;
// - `sync_through`, `sync_through_then_peek_with_emitter`, and `sync_balanced` take only an
//   emitter mark (no lineage entry, no pin, so no container to reserve): their preflight is a
//   hoist — the caller-supplied dedup-watermark clone moves above the mark, so nothing fallible
//   is left between the mark and the finished `ThroughEntry` that owns it.
//
// One capture is a documented exception rather than a ninth site: `rollback_to`'s re-save needs
// no reservation of its own, because the savepoint pops immediately above it already free the
// very slot its push lands in.
//
// A capture site added without its preflight is dropped raw by the very first unwinding
// insertion after it. Take the reservation (or the hoist) before the capture — a capture taken
// before its owner can accept it is stranded by an unwinding insertion — then extend this census
// in the same commit (grep CAPTURE_WINDOW).

///   **function**; Rust exposes no frame size at compile time, so "this body reserves one
///   window" is not statable as a type-level fact.
/// - a runtime stack measurement was tried and rejected on the evidence recorded beside
///   the fixture: an unoptimized build materializes roughly seven window-sized copies
///   around the fill, so the term under test is under a seventh of the frame and any
///   threshold over it is a magic number a compiler release moves.

// POSTURE_CENSUS — the scan family's `# Panic unwind` sections, which are documentation and

//
// These paragraphs were once held together by a **byte-identity** requirement: edit one, copy it
// to the other two, confirm the three hash the same. That requirement was itself the defect. The
// paragraph it propagated was written for `sync_to` and opens "this method's `to`-shaped commit
// posture keeps the diagnosed prefix" — which is true of `sync_to` and false of the other two,
// whose own `ScanMode`s the very same sentence goes on to call *the rewinding scans*.
// `sync_through` consumes on a stop and rewinds at a no-match end of input; `sync_balanced`
// crosses the axes, keeping on a stop like the first and rewinding at end of input like the
// second. Three different postures cannot share one true sentence, so identity could only ever
// have been kept by making two of the three wrong.
//
// What byte-identity was really buying is anti-drift, and that survives the split as three checks:
//
//   (a) the ONE clause every member must share — the end-of-input-settle exclusion, which is a
//       property of the shared `ScanScope` (it disarms before the settle runs) and therefore
//       genuinely common. Dropping it from one file while editing another is the drift that
//       identity used to catch, and this is the half that still catches it;
//   (b) the four sections must stay pairwise DISTINCT, and no member may carry the retired
//       sentence. Re-unifying them is not a merge conflict, it produces no warning, and it is
//       exactly how the false claim spread the first time;
//   (c) each section must state the posture its own `ScanMode` ACTUALLY has, derived from that
//       mode's associated constants as they are written in `scan.rs`.
//
// (c) is not optional garnish, and (a) + (b) alone were a check that answers without looking:
// four paragraphs can carry the shared exclusion, avoid the retired sentence, and be pairwise
// different while every one of them describes the wrong method — permuting the four sections
// passes (a) and (b) outright. Distinctness is not correctness. (c) closes that by keying each
// file's required AND forbidden phrases to `HOLDS_ENTRY`, `COMMITS_FRONTIER_ON_STOP` and
// `REPORT_SKIPPED`, whose value triples are pairwise different across the four modes — so every
// permutation trips at least one phrase, and a future change to a constant forces the prose to
// change with it rather than silently outliving it.
//
// Both halves of (c) read TEXT, and text that talks about code reads like code — so both are read
// against the thing itself rather than against something that resembles it. On the source side,
// `scan.rs` is blanked of comments and of string, byte-string and character literals before any
// constant is taken from it, and the impl is brace-matched to its own top level: a comment spelling
// `const HOLDS_ENTRY: bool = true;`, a panic message quoting one, a neighbouring impl's constant and
// one declared inside a method body are all invisible to the reader. On the doc side a required
// phrase counts only where nothing negates it, because a substring survives its own denial —
// "**never** stops *before* the stopping token" contains "stops *before* the stopping token". A
// census a sentence can satisfy is the same unchecked claim this one exists to catch, one level up.
//
// The residual bounds worth naming:
//
//   - the constants are read from `scan.rs`'s SOURCE, because `ScanMode`'s constants cannot be
//     named without instantiating `L`/`Ctx`/`Cmpl`, and the only concrete lexers in this crate live
//     behind the logos features that this census module deliberately does not require. So the
//     coupling is textual: adding a FOURTH posture axis to `ScanMode`, or changing
//     `ScanScope::keeps_on_unwind`'s formula, is not caught by the reader itself — the
//     `keeps_on_unwind` pin in (c) covers the second, and the first is what the `POSTURE_PHRASES`
//     doc comment asks the next editor to extend. Blanking and brace-matching close what a
//     substring reader can be *fed*; what it can be *shown* — a `cfg`-gated second arm, a
//     macro-generated impl — is closed only by parsing `scan.rs` as Rust, and that is deliberately
//     not here;
//   - negation is scoped to the phrase's own clause (back to the nearest comma, semicolon or
//     sentence end), so a denial on the far side of one does not disqualify an occurrence. And only
//     the REQUIRED side is negation-aware: a forbidden phrase trips the census however it is
//     worded, including inside a true contrast ("this does not consume the stopping token"). Both
//     of those are the conservative direction — a section may not lean on a negated requirement,
//     and a forbidden posture is reworded rather than denied.
//
// Prose is compared with `///` stripped and whitespace collapsed, so rewrapping a paragraph is
// not drift and does not fail this. A new scan mode with a `# Panic unwind` section joins the

/// opening sentence blames a panic on. A section can pass every posture phrase and still name a
/// source its own method cannot produce: `skip_while` named "the expected-tokens closure" while
/// its only route to one passes an internal `|| None` that is never even called, because
/// `skip_and_report`'s sole `exp()` call site — `M::REPORT_SKIPPED.then(|| .. exp() ..)` — sits
/// behind a bool that is `false` for `SkipWhile`. `REPORT_SKIPPED` is exactly that gate, read out
/// of `scan.rs` as the other checks do, so this closes the gap with the same derivation rather
/// than a hand-authored per-file list: flip `REPORT_SKIPPED` on a mode and the requirement on its
/// section's callback list flips with it.
///
/// This does not attempt the general case (an arbitrary callback/source named in arbitrary prose).
/// It closes the one vocabulary item this finding was about, the way it can actually be closed —
/// derived from a real source-level gate, not asserted by fiat. `sync_balanced`'s "the classifier"
/// is a real, method-specific panic source with no `ScanMode` constant to derive a requirement
/// from (the classifier is `sync_balanced`'s own parameter, not part of the `ScanMode` trait), so
/// it is out of scope for a derived check and is not asserted here.
