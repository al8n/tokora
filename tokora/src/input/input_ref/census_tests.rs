//! SETTLE_CENSUS / RELEASE_CENSUS — the source censuses of every place a committed token
//! settles, and of every place an emitter checkpoint is spent or forgotten.
//!
//! # Why a census, and why here
//!
//! A token becomes *committed* at a handful of settle sites spread across the consume
//! surface: the `next` arms, the `consume_cached` family, the `try_expect` accept arms,
//! the shared scanner's skip/stop settles. Any side channel that must observe committed
//! tokens exactly once (a CST event stream riding the emitter, a lossless trivia view)
//! has to hook **all** of them — an invariant enforced at N call sites instead of one
//! chokepoint, with N ≈ a dozen on day one. The crate's answer is the same as everywhere
//! else: one primitive ([`InputRef::commit_token`](super::InputRef)), every consume
//! settle routed through it, and a census that fails the build the moment a settle
//! appears outside it.
//!
//! Rust has no call-site reflection, so — exactly like `OP_SURFACE_CENSUS` in
//! `src/fuzz/ops.rs` — the residual "notice a new site exists" step is anchored by a
//! greppable marker and a consciously-maintained count. These tests are that count: they
//! read the `input_ref` sources with `include_str!` and assert the exact number of
//! settle-surface calls per file. Adding a consume path without routing it through the
//! primitive moves a count and fails a named test whose message carries the checklist.
//! `grep SETTLE_CENSUS` finds every anchor.
//!
//! # The census (what must stay true)
//!
//! **Every 1:1 consume settle goes through `commit_token`** — the fourteen sites:
//! `next()`'s cached and fresh-lex arms (2), `consume_cached_one` and
//! `consume_cached_to`'s loop body (2 — `consume_all_cached` drains *through*
//! `consume_cached_to`, per token), the `try_expect`/`try_expect_map`/
//! `try_expect_and_then`/`try_expect_or_stop` cached and accept arms (8), the
//! by-value `commit_probed` settle of a probed closer (1), and
//! `SyncThrough::on_stop` (1).
//!
//! **The one skip settle is `AtFrontier::adopt`**, called only by `skip_and_report`: a
//! token a scan skips settles behind the frontier — not into the input's span — exactly
//! once, whichever origin fed it. It is the settle surface's second (and last) member.
//!
//! **The span funnel is not a settle.** `set_span_after_consume` is also written by
//! three non-token paths, and they must **never** grow a settle hook: `settle_fatal`
//! writes a *rejected lexer error's* span; `SyncTo::on_eof` writes the lexer's span at
//! exhaustion; `commit_at` batch-writes a whole skipped run's frontier (each skipped
//! token already settled via `adopt`). Peeks, declines, `unconsume`, and the
//! position-write surgeries (`set_state`, restores) touch no settle at all.
//!
//! Counting is line-based and skips `//`-prefixed lines, so doc references to these
//! names do not count; only code does. Keep code mentions of the counted names off
//! comment-trailing positions and out of string literals in these files.

// say so through `release` — otherwise a mark-keyed emitter (a checkpoint stack, an
// event sink) strands one row per committed guard, forever. The keep paths funnel:
//
// - every kept `Checkpoint` goes through `InputRef::forget_kept_checkpoint` — the raw
//   commit, both transaction guards' commit and commit-on-drop arms, the stacked guard's
//   savepoint release/commit/drop — which pairs the lineage forget with the emitter

//   five committing exits of `skip_until` (boundary drain, fatal lex propagation, trip,
//   stop, fatal report propagation); the sixth exit is `on_eof`, which spends the mark
//   by rewinding to it.
//
// The third keep path is a session point abandoned by dropping the handle: `Session`'s
// `Drop` settles it exactly as `commit_point` would — unpin, forget the lineage id, and
// release the emitter mark — through the assert-free primitives rather than the
// `forget_kept_checkpoint` funnel (a drop may run mid-unwind, where the funnel's debug
