  /// restored, so a later genuine consume of the same region reports its
  /// errors exactly once.
  ///
  /// This holds even when the caller had prefilled the cache with peeked
  /// lookahead: a failed sync rewinds the drained cache prefix too, restoring
  /// the pre-call position, at the cost of re-lexing those formerly-cached
  /// tokens on the next read.
  ///
  /// # The fatal exit commits, and the cache never changes it
  ///
  /// A fatal emitter rejection mid-skip follows the sync family's fatal-exit discipline: the
  /// token that trips the emitter — a skipped token whose unexpected-token diagnostic the
  /// emitter rejected, or a lexer error it rejected — is **committed**, and the error
  /// propagates. A caller that catches it therefore resumes *after* the reported token, and
  /// never re-reads or re-reports it.
  ///
  /// Whether that token had already been peeked into the cache makes no difference: the cache
  /// is an invisible optimization, so every observable of a sync call — its return, the
  /// committed position and lexer state, the diagnostics it emits, the poison boundary, and
  /// the lexer-error dedup watermark — is a function of the token stream alone, never of how
  /// much of it had been prefetched. (The one thing a caller *can* see is that a peek emits
  /// the lexer errors it crosses when it crosses them, so prefetching moves such a diagnostic
  /// earlier in the log; the dedup watermark still reports it exactly once.) The
  /// `cache_transparency_matrix` tests in `src/input/input_ref/tests.rs` pin this
  /// across the whole family.
  ///
  /// # Partial mode: an `Incomplete` exit leaves no trace
  ///
  /// Under [`Partial`](crate::input::Partial), a non-final buffer can end mid-scan and this
  /// method surfaces `Incomplete`. That exit commits nothing, so it keeps nothing: the position,
  /// the lexer state, the dedup watermark and every emission the aborted attempt made — each
  /// skipped token's `commit_token` event included — are restored to the call's entry. Refill
  /// and call again and the retry is idempotent; nothing accumulates per attempt.
  ///
  /// # Panic unwind
  ///
  /// A panic out of the predicate, the expected-tokens closure, the lexer or the emitter
  /// **anywhere but the end-of-input settle** is an exit too, and it settles with **this method's
  /// own posture** — which is *not* [`sync_to`](Self::sync_to)'s `to`-shaped commit. This scan
  /// **consumes the stopping token**, committing at its own span, and **rewinds the full pre-call
  /// state at a no-match end of input**, and its unwind edge follows that same split, decided by
  /// the exit reached rather than by the method:
  ///
  /// - **before the predicate has answered stop** — the whole of the scan, in practice — an unwind
  ///   takes the no-match exit's posture: the retained stream is cleared and the position, the
  ///   lexer state, the dedup watermark and every emission the abandoned scan made are restored to
  ///   the call's entry. `sync_through_unwind_restores_emissions`
  ///   (`src/input/input_ref/tests.rs`) reads a resume cursor of `0` with all four tokens of
  ///   `"ab cd ef gh"` still reachable and `0` emissions surviving. Restoring at the panic edge
  ///   carries a price a true end of input does not — there the cache is empty by construction,
  ///   here it can still hold an untouched suffix, which re-lexes — and that price is pinned rather
  ///   than left as prose, at seven scans of the four-token source, by
  ///   `sync_through_warm_unwind_prices_its_re_lex`;
  /// - **once it has**, which is inside the stop settle itself, the scan keeps: the diagnosed
  ///   prefix is committed at the frontier — the end of the last *skipped* token, since the commit
  ///   at the matching token's own span is the very step the unwind interrupted — and the stream is
  ///   cleared against it. Cleared rather than put back, because by then the token has been handed
  ///   to that settle: [`sync_to`](Self::sync_to) states the held-versus-handed-over split in full,
  ///   and this method reaches its keeping arm only on the handed-over side of it.
  ///
  /// Either way the committed position never advances past a token nothing recorded, so no token is
  /// lost and no emitter mark is stranded.
  ///
  /// The exclusion is the one [`skip_while`](Self::skip_while) states, and it costs this method
  /// nothing: the scope is disarmed before the end-of-input settle runs, but for a rewinding scan
  /// that settle **is** the restore, and the scan holds every byte of its progress in an
  /// uncommitted frontier — the position was never advanced off the call's entry for a dropped
  /// frontier to strand it away from. What remains at stake there is the *rest* of the restore, and
  /// it is measured rather than argued: `r9_restore_entry_is_atomic_at_every_offset_clone`
  /// (`src/input/input_ref/tests.rs`) sweeps every [`L::Offset`](crate::Lexer::Offset) clone the
  /// exit performs, panicking at each in turn, and demands the same three readings at all — the
  /// entry position, no stranded emitter mark, and the abandoned scan's diagnostics **rewound**
  /// away rather than merely released.
