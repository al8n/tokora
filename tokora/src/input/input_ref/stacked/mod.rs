/// stack while the transaction stays open.
///
/// # Not a durable position token
///
/// A `SavepointId` is *branded* with the lifetime of the transaction that issued it, so

/// beyond the transaction, capture a [`Cursor`](super::Cursor) or a span instead.
///
/// # How a misused id is caught
///
/// Identity is layered, from compile time down to a runtime check, with no global state
/// — no counter, no atomic — behind any of it:
///
/// - **Temporal misuse** — using an id after its transaction ended, or holding one across
///   the next [`begin_stacked`](InputRef::begin_stacked) on the same input — is a
///   **compile error**: the id's invariant lifetime brand keeps the input loan open while
///   the id is live, so the borrow checker rejects reopening it.
/// - **Cross-parser misuse** — an id from another, simultaneously-live transaction over a
///   *different* input — **panics in every build**: each id carries the address of an
///   Input-owned field, and two live inputs occupy distinct addresses.
/// - **Intra-transaction staleness** — an id destroyed by an earlier `rollback_to` /
///   `release` on the same transaction, or one whose checkpoint a raw restore below it
///   invalidated (see the mixing rules on [`StackedTransaction`]) — **panics in every
///   build** via a membership scan of the live savepoints and their lineage (see
///   [`rollback_to`](StackedTransaction::rollback_to)). State surgery is transactional and
///   does *not* invalidate a savepoint.
///
/// # Compile-time rejections
///
/// The temporal and nesting misuses never reach a runtime check — the borrow checker
/// rejects them. Each snippet below fails to compile.
///
/// Reusing an id after its transaction ended (here, across the next `begin_stacked` on the

/// | [`savepoint`](Self::savepoint) | `SAVEPOINT` | mark the current position, return an id |
/// | [`rollback_to`](Self::rollback_to) | `ROLLBACK TO` | return to a mark, destroy the younger savepoints, keep the mark |
/// | [`release`](Self::release) | `RELEASE SAVEPOINT` | forget a mark and the younger ones, keep the parsed progress |
/// | [`commit`](Self::commit) | `COMMIT` | keep everything, forget all savepoints |
/// | [`rollback`](Self::rollback) | `ROLLBACK` | return to the begin point, discard everything |
///
/// Rolling back to an older savepoint always destroys every newer one, so out-of-order
/// revival is impossible by construction — the [`restore`](InputRef::restore) discipline
/// holds because the internal stack only ever shrinks from the top. A misused
/// [`SavepointId`] is rejected in layers: a temporally-misused id at compile time via its
/// lifetime brand, a foreign id from another live parser and a stale id both by a runtime
/// check in every build — see [`SavepointId`].
///
/// [`commit`](Self::commit) and [`rollback`](Self::rollback) consume the transaction and
/// are available whatever the drop policy. What an *undecided* transaction does on drop is

/// # Mixing with raw save/restore, state surgery, and nested transactions
///
/// The guard deref-coerces to [`InputRef`], so raw [`save`](InputRef::save) /
/// [`restore`](InputRef::restore) and the nested backtracking tools are all reachable
/// through it. These rules govern how they interact with the live savepoints and the begin
/// point:
///
/// - **A raw restore below a savepoint (but above the base) invalidates the savepoint —
///   detect-at-use.** Savepoints are not pinned (only the base is), so this restore *succeeds*;
///   it rolls the lineage back past the savepoint's own checkpoint, so the savepoint is no
///   longer on a live lineage, and [`rollback_to`](Self::rollback_to) / [`release`](Self::release)
///   with it **panics as stale in every build** — release and no-`target_has_atomic`-ptr targets
///   included. Restoring the wrong lineage is never silently honored.
/// - **A raw restore below the begin point would tear out the whole transaction —
///   detect-at-cause.** Restoring a raw checkpoint taken *before*
///   [`begin_stacked`](InputRef::begin_stacked) would pop the **pinned** base off the live
///   lineage, so in allocator builds it **panics at the restore itself** (`restore would
///   invalidate a live transaction guard or attempt …`) — refused where it is caused, before any
///   commit/rollback decision. On allocator-less targets there is no pin set, so this is
///   unspecified-but-bounded rather than checked; in allocator builds the older detect-at-use
///   backstops (an explicit [`rollback`](Self::rollback) asserting a live base, a rolling-back
///   drop skipping a stale one) remain as defense in depth behind the pin check.
/// - **State surgery, nested `attempt` / `try_attempt` / [`Transaction`](super::Transaction),
///   and a LIFO-clean raw save/restore pair taken *above* the savepoints, are all legal and
///   do not disturb the savepoints.** [`set_state`](InputRef::set_state) /
///   [`state_mut`](InputRef::state_mut) re-key the forward-scanning facts but are
///   transactional — a savepoint taken before the surgery stays valid, and
///   [`rollback_to`](Self::rollback_to) it *undoes* the surgery (the regime, boundary,
///   watermark, and position all return). A nested speculation that saves and then restores
///   or commits its own younger checkpoint leaves every savepoint below it untouched.
///
/// The raw-restore rules above are reachable only with the `unstable-raw` feature. Without it,
/// raw [`save`](InputRef::save) / [`restore`](InputRef::restore) are crate-internal, so a
/// downstream crate cannot mix a raw restore into a live transaction at all — only the savepoint
/// operations and nested guards remain, and none of those can invalidate a savepoint.
