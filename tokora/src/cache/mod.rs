/// A trait for caching lookahead tokens in the tokenizer.
///
/// `Cache` provides a buffer for tokens that have been lexed but not yet consumed,
/// enabling efficient lookahead and backtracking operations. The cache acts as a
/// queue (FIFO - First In, First Out) between the lexer and the parser.
///
/// # Purpose
///
/// The cache serves several critical functions:
/// - **Lookahead**: Allows peeking at future tokens without consuming them
/// - **Backtracking**: Supports parser backtracking via checkpoint/rewind operations
/// - **Efficiency**: Avoids re-lexing tokens that have already been processed
/// - **State Management**: Preserves lexer state (extras) alongside each token
///
/// # Design Patterns
///
/// Different implementations support different use cases:
/// - **Fixed-size arrays**: Bounded lookahead with known maximum (e.g., `[CachedToken; 4]`)
/// - **Dynamic buffers**: Unlimited lookahead using `Vec` or `VecDeque`
/// - **BlackHole**: No caching at all, for streaming-only scenarios without backtracking
///
/// Note: Tokens cannot be overwritten until explicitly consumed, as they must remain
/// available for backtracking operations. This means the cache can become full and
/// refuse new tokens if capacity is reached.
///
/// # Cache Operations
///
/// The cache supports standard queue operations:
/// - `push_back`: Add newly lexed tokens to the end (fails if cache is full)
/// - `pop_front`: Remove and return the oldest token
/// - `peek`: View tokens without removing them
/// - `rewind`: Restore to a previous state (for backtracking)
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The `peek` method is marked unsafe because it requires implementations to guarantee
/// that returned slices only contain properly initialized tokens. This is enforced by
/// the trait's contract.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// // A simple fixed-size cache using a VecDeque-like structure
/// struct BoundedCache<'a, T: Token<'a>> {
///     tokens: VecDeque<CachedToken<'a, T>>,
///     capacity: usize,
/// }
