/// A trait for caching lookahead tokens in the tokenizer.
///
/// `Cache` provides a buffer for tokens that have been lexed but not yet consumed,
/// enabling efficient lookahead and backtracking operations. The cache acts as a
/// queue (FIFO - First In, First Out) between the lexer and the parser.
///
/// # Purpose
///
/// The cache serves several critical functions:
/// - **Lookahead**: Allows peeking at future tokens without consuming them
/// - **Backtracking**: Supports parser backtracking via checkpoint/rewind operations
/// - **Efficiency**: Avoids re-lexing tokens that have already been processed
/// - **State Management**: Preserves lexer state (extras) alongside each token
///
/// # The implementations, and the limit
///
/// The complete inventory is three, all bounded at compile time:
///
/// - `ArrayDeque<_, N>` — a fixed-capacity ring, `N` a `typenum` bound.
///   [`DefaultCache`] is this at `U3`.
/// - `Option<CachedToken<..>>` — capacity 1, the smallest cache that can still retain the front.
/// - `()` — capacity 0: no caching at all, for streaming-only use without lookahead.
///
/// There is **no dynamic, allocator-backed cache**, and enabling `alloc` does not add one — it
/// enables allocator-backed *containers and drivers*, and forwards the sub-crates' own `alloc`
/// features. Nor would one buy unbounded lookahead: [`crate::Window`] is sealed at
/// **U1–U32**, so no cache of any capacity — built-in or downstream — can serve a public peek
/// past 32 tokens. Lookahead beyond the window is what **transactions** are for: an
/// [`attempt`](crate::InputRef::attempt) or a [`Transaction`](crate::Transaction) speculates
/// arbitrarily far and re-lexes on rollback, which is unbounded speculation without an unbounded
/// buffer.
///
/// Note: Tokens cannot be overwritten until explicitly consumed, as they must remain
/// available for backtracking operations. This means the cache can become full and
/// refuse new tokens if capacity is reached.
///
/// # The contract: a cache is a queue, and only a queue
///
/// The input layer owns every decision about *which* tokens should be resident; a cache decides
/// only whether it has room. These are the laws it must uphold, phrased over what a caller can
/// observe — the cache conformance kit checks each one:
///
/// - **FIFO append.** [`push_back`](Cache::push_back) places the token after every resident
///   entry; [`push_front`](Cache::push_front) places it before every resident entry. A push is
///   refused **only when the cache is full** — both arms, not just `push_back`'s — and a refused
///   push returns the token **unchanged** and leaves the cache exactly as it was.
/// - **Order.** [`pop_front`](Cache::pop_front) removes the **oldest** resident entry and
///   [`pop_back`](Cache::pop_back) the **newest**; [`front`](Cache::front) and
///   [`back`](Cache::back) view those same two entries without removing them.
/// - **Exact length.** [`len`](Cache::len) is exactly the resident count, and
///   [`remaining`](Cache::remaining) is exactly how many more `push_back`s will be accepted.
/// - **Bounded, pure peek.** [`peek`](Cache::peek) appends exactly
///   `min(len(), buf`'s **remaining** capacity at call time`)` entries to the buffer, oldest
///   first, once each, leaving whatever `buf` already held untouched. The bound is the room the
///   buffer has **left** — `buf.remaining_capacity()`, not `buf.capacity()`; the two agree only
///   for a buffer that arrives empty, and the peek fill hands over both shapes — empty on a
///   cache hit or an overflow-free fill, already holding the parked token or staged overflow
///   otherwise. It is logically pure: it takes `&self`, calling it twice yields the same
///   sequence, and it changes no observable. Borrowed and owned results denote the same tokens.
/// - **The restore path must not panic.** [`pop_front`](Cache::pop_front),
///   [`pop_back`](Cache::pop_back), [`clear`](Cache::clear), [`front`](Cache::front),
///   [`front_span`](Cache::front_span), [`len`](Cache::len) — **and
///   [`push_front`](Cache::push_front)** — are called by the input layer from guard drops, which
///   can run **mid-unwind**, where a panic aborts the process. `push_front` is on that list for a
///   reason worth stating: a scan's unwind edge puts the in-flight token back through it, so it
///   is a restore-path operation even though it is the only *writing* one. A `push_front` that
///   panics on the normal path is also the one place the crate cannot make whole — it has taken
///   the token by value, so the token goes with it.
/// - [`RETAINS_FRONT`](Cache::RETAINS_FRONT) carries its own law, and it is checked: declaring
///   `true` and then refusing a front push into an empty cache panics at the refusal site.
///
/// What is deliberately **not** on this list is any notion of a checkpoint. A cache never sees
/// one. The cursor-keyed geometry a restore needs is performed by the input layer through the
/// queue surface above, beside the push-generation bookkeeping only it can do. (`Cache::rewind`
/// used to ask a cache to do the first half from facts it was never given; see
/// [`InputRef::restore`](crate::InputRef::restore) and the 0.8.0 changelog.)
///
/// Also not on it: **which** of these operations an input path performs. The laws above fix what
/// each operation *means*; the choice between two calls that mean the same thing belongs to the
/// input layer and may change between versions. A head served by [`front`](Cache::front) and the
/// same head served by [`len`](Cache::len) + [`peek`](Cache::peek) are the same read, and
/// [`InputRef::peek_head_map`](crate::InputRef::peek_head_map) makes the first call where its
/// general route makes the other two. A conforming cache cannot tell them apart — every one of
/// those is a `&self` read that changes no observable — so a cache that *counts* its calls is
/// measuring the input layer, not the token stream.
///
/// The positive form of that, and the one to implement against: **make every method inert** — let
/// it do only what its own law above says it does, and always return normally. An inert cache
/// cannot tell one contract-equal choice of operations from another, so every such choice is free.
/// That is the same rule [`skip_while`](crate::InputRef::skip_while) and
/// [`peek_head_map`](crate::InputRef::peek_head_map) state as a condition on the caller, seen from
/// the end that implements it.
///
/// **Inert is the whole requirement**; what follows is not the set of ways to miss it. Two that
/// come up, and what each costs:
///
/// * **it counts.** Harmless while the count stays inside the cache. It stops being harmless the
///   moment the count reaches a **predicate or closure the same caller supplies** — a `skip_while`
///   predicate, a `peek_head_map` `f` — because then a measurement of the input layer becomes a
///   parse decision, and which operations ran decides which tokens are consumed;
/// * **it unwinds.** A method with a reachable panic path turns *which operations an input path
///   chose* into control flow. `skip_while` over a resident head that has nothing to skip reads
///   the head with [`front`](Cache::front) where the scan it replaces would have called
///   [`pop_front`](Cache::pop_front) and [`push_front`](Cache::push_front); if either of those can
///   panic, one route unwinds and the other returns `Ok(())`. The value guarantees on those two
///   methods are not made to a caller whose cache can do that.
///
/// Both are the same rule written on the trait that would be doing it, and the rule is the
/// sentence above them rather than the two bullets: a third way of losing inertness would cost the
/// same, and would need no amendment here.

  /// regime the input will later make live — and [`State`](crate::state::State) is bounded
  /// `Debug + Clone` and nothing more, so a perfectly valid one may hold interior mutability. A
  /// grammar handed `&L::State` from the cache could flip a `Cell<Mode>` inside a token's
  /// post-state, consume that token to install the altered regime, and have a rollback restore the
  /// live state, the regime id and the offset while the consumed entry stays absent — the retry
  /// then re-lexes from an unaltered state and can succeed, over an input
  /// [`InputRef::scanner_outcome`](crate::InputRef::scanner_outcome) has just called
  /// [`Stalled`](crate::input::ScannerOutcome::Stalled).
  ///
  /// **This is the one type through which that can happen**, so it is where the cut is made rather
  /// than at each door. Every public surface that hands out a cached token —
  /// [`InputRef::cache`](crate::InputRef::cache) and the [`Cache`] views behind it,
  /// [`InputRef::peek_one`](crate::InputRef::peek_one), every `peek` and `sync_*_then_peek`
  /// result — hands out this type, so closing it here closes all of them at once, including the
  /// ones nobody has written yet.
  ///
  /// What survives is everything that does not read the regime: [`token`](Self::token),
  /// [`into_token`](Self::into_token), [`as_ref`](Self::as_ref), [`map_token`](Self::map_token)
  /// and [`Clone`]. A [`Cache`] implementation therefore still stores, returns, splits and clones
  /// entries exactly as before — it never needed to read one — while nothing downstream can read
  /// or fabricate a regime, since [`new`](Self::new) is crate-internal too.
  // Every reader is feature-gated — the `conformance` cache kit and the in-crate suites — so the
