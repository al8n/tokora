/// The result of lexing a single token: either a successful token or an error.
///
/// `Lexed` represents the output of the lexing process for a single position in the input.
/// It can either be a successfully recognized [`Token`] with its span information, or a
/// lexing error that occurred at that position.
///
/// # Error Handling Strategy
///
/// `Lexed` enables **error recovery** during lexing by keeping errors in the token stream
/// rather than immediately aborting. This allows you to:
///
/// - Continue lexing after an error to find multiple issues in one pass
/// - Collect all lexing errors before reporting them to the user
/// - Implement "best-effort" parsing that tolerates some malformed input
/// - Provide better diagnostics by showing multiple errors at once
///
/// # Convenience Methods
///
/// Thanks to the `derive_more` macros, `Lexed` provides several utility methods:
///
/// - `is_token()` / `is_error()`: Check which variant this is
/// - `unwrap_token()` / `unwrap_error()`: Unwrap to get the inner value (panics if wrong variant)
/// - `try_unwrap_token()` / `try_unwrap_error()`: Safe unwrapping that returns `Option`
/// - `unwrap_token_ref()` / `unwrap_error_ref()`: Get a reference to the inner value
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ## Basic Usage
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use tokora::{Lexed, TokenExt};
///
/// let mut lexer = logos::Lexer::<MyTokens>::new(input);
///
/// while let Some(lexed) = MyToken::lex(&mut lexer) {
///     match lexed {
///         Lexed::Token(spanned_token) => {
///             println!("Token: {:?} at {:?}", spanned_token.data(), spanned_token.span());
///         }
///         Lexed::Error(err) => {
///             eprintln!("Lexing error: {:?}", err);
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Error Collection
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let mut tokens = Vec::new();
/// let mut errors = Vec::new();
///
/// let mut lexer = logos::Lexer::<MyTokens>::new(input);
/// while let Some(lexed) = MyToken::lex(&mut lexer) {
///     match lexed {
///         Lexed::Token(tok) => tokens.push(tok),
///         Lexed::Error(err) => errors.push(err),
///     }
/// }
///
/// if !errors.is_empty() {
///     report_lexing_errors(&errors);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Using Convenience Methods
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// if lexed.is_token() {
///     let token = lexed.unwrap_token_ref();
///     process_token(token);
/// }
///
/// // Safe unwrapping
/// if let Some(token) = lexed.try_unwrap_token() {

/// # The lexer contract
///
/// tokora's input layer ([`InputRef`](crate::InputRef)) pulls tokens from a lexer on
/// demand and, to support lookahead and backtracking, **rebuilds a fresh lexer per
/// operation and re-lexes on demand any region it needs again** — the prefix a
/// checkpoint restore rewinds, and any cached token an abandoned branch dropped or a
/// cache truncation discarded. That reconstruction is always the same two steps
/// ([`InputRef::lexer`](crate::InputRef::lexer)): `L::with_state(src, saved_state)`
/// followed by [`bump`](Lexer::bump) to the committed offset. The clauses below are
/// the properties that make that machinery correct.
///
/// They are a *contract*, not a set of `unsafe` invariants: breaking one is neither
/// undefined behavior nor memory-unsafe, but it makes the input layer's observable
/// behavior unspecified (see [*Violation posture*](#violation-posture)). The bundled
/// Logos backend upholds every clause; a hand-written lexer must uphold them itself,
/// and the `conformance` kit checks a lexer against them.
///
/// ## Determinism: scanning is a pure function of source, position, and state
///
/// Every scan-visible result — which token [`lex`](Lexer::lex) decides, its span,
/// whether the item is a token or an [`Error`](Lexed::Error), and any limit
/// accounting [`check`](Lexer::check) reports — must derive **entirely** from the
/// source, the offset being lexed at, and the lexer [`State`](Lexer::State). Nothing
/// may route through state a checkpoint's `State` snapshot cannot capture and a
/// restore therefore cannot rewind: a shared counter, an ambient global, an
/// allocator address. Determinism is what makes replay observationally identical to
/// the run it rewound, and two concrete mechanisms depend on it:
///
/// - **prefix replay after a checkpoint restore** —
///   [`restore`](crate::InputRef::restore) copies the saved [`State`](Lexer::State),
///   span, poison boundary, and lexer-error dedup watermark back, and drops the cache
///   entries pushed since the save; the region they covered is re-lexed on demand and
///   must reproduce the identical items;
/// - **cache truncation** — a peek lexes ahead and caches tokens; when a branch is
///   abandoned or the cache is drained, those tokens are dropped and re-lexed on the
///   next read.
///
/// Re-lexing the same source from the same offset and state must reproduce the
/// identical item and the identical accounting. (Scan *counting* held **outside**
/// `State` — e.g. a test probe — legitimately observes the extra re-lex scans; that
/// is instrumentation, not a scan-visible result.)
///
/// ## State faithfulness and cheapness
///
/// A resume point is the pair (**[`State`](Lexer::State)**, **offset**):
/// [`with_state`](Lexer::with_state) carries the *mode* — every scanning regime the
/// lexer can be in (nesting depth, string-vs-normal mode, a resource limiter's tally)
/// — and [`bump`](Lexer::bump) carries the *position*. Position is deliberately **not**
/// encoded in `State`; the input layer threads it separately through `bump`. Together
/// the pair must be sufficient: rebuilding with `L::with_state(src, saved_state)` and
/// bumping to the saved offset must reproduce **exactly** the suffix the original
/// lexer would have produced from the moment that state was captured. The state that
/// pairs with a given item is the one observed *right after* [`lex`](Lexer::lex)
/// returned it, and the offset it pairs with is that item's span end.
///
/// `State` is cloned on **every** checkpoint ([`save`](crate::InputRef::save) clones
/// it, and every cached token stores a clone), so cloning must be cheap. Keep it
/// `Copy` or small; if it must own heavy data, store a handle (e.g. `Arc`) inside it
/// so clones stay inexpensive.
///
/// ## Monotone progress: spans never move backward, every scan advances
///
/// Over a run, span starts are **non-decreasing**, and every produced item — a token
/// or an [`Error`](Lexed::Error) — has a **nonempty** span: its [`span`](Lexer::span)
/// end is strictly greater than its start. A zero-width span (end equal to start) is a
/// contract violation. The input layer reasons about the stream *positionally* —
/// cached spans, the lexer-error dedup watermark, and the poison boundary past which
/// lexing stops are all offsets that assume every lexed item advances the position —
/// so a zero-width item is at once excluded (it starts at the boundary) and
/// non-advancing (it consumes nothing), which silently degrades replay and, worse,
/// *termination*: a lexer that never advances yields an unbounded zero-width run.
/// Debug builds assert the nonempty span at the input layer's single lexing chokepoint
/// (`lex_within_boundary`); release builds omit it. [`lex`](Lexer::lex) restates this
/// clause on the method itself.
///
/// ## Exhaustion is sticky
///
/// Once [`lex`](Lexer::lex) returns `None`, every subsequent [`lex`](Lexer::lex) on
/// that same instance must keep returning `None` — exhaustion never "un-exhausts".
/// The input layer never re-polls a single instance past its first `None` (both
/// scanning loops stop there), but it relies on the *positional* face of the same
/// property: on end of input a scan commits no progress, so the committed offset stays
/// put and the **next** operation rebuilds a fresh lexer at that same offset and
/// re-lexes it — which, by determinism, must return `None` again. Sticky `None` is
/// what lets a parse terminate at end of input instead of looping. (The bundled Logos
/// backend additionally latches a *limit* trip to sticky `None`; that is a stronger
/// backend guarantee documented on its `LogosLexer`, not a requirement on every
/// lexer.)
///
/// ## Truncation faithfulness (partial-input mode only)
///
/// When the input layer is driven in [`Partial`](crate::input::Partial) (Sans-I/O) mode, one
/// further property is assumed — it is inert for a [`Complete`](crate::input::Complete) parse. A
/// produced item (token or [`Error`](Lexed::Error)) whose span ends **strictly before the buffer
/// end** must be **stable under appended input**: its decision — token-vs-error, kind, and span —
/// must derive only from source bytes up to its own span end, never from bytes further ahead. The
/// frontier holdback withholds exactly the one item whose span *reaches* the buffer end (the
/// maximal-munch one-boundary-byte lookahead is safe, because that boundary byte is present
/// precisely when the item is yielded), so a lexer that decides an item from bytes *beyond* its
/// span breaks the chunked-equivalence guarantee — a prefix parse would produce a different item
/// than the whole. A maximal-munch lexer (the Logos backend, and every hand-written lexer that
/// commits each item from its own bytes) satisfies this; the `conformance` kit's `run_partial`
/// check exercises it over every split point.
///
/// ## Span / slice coherence
///
/// [`slice`](Lexer::slice) must equal the source content at [`span`](Lexer::span):
/// slicing the source over `span().start..span().end` yields exactly `slice()`, and
/// every span lies within source bounds (`0 <= start <= end <= source.len()`). The
/// input layer builds its own slices from spans over the source
/// ([`InputRef::slice`](crate::InputRef::slice)), so a span that disagrees with the
/// slice, or points outside the source, yields wrong text or a panic.
///
/// ## Composite tokens own their contents (token-level nesting)
///
/// A composite token — a block string, a raw/heredoc literal, a comment — is **one**
/// token whose span covers the whole construct; the lexer must **swallow every
/// delimiter character inside it** and emit no nested delimiter tokens for them. The
/// recovery scanner [`sync_balanced`](crate::InputRef::sync_balanced) counts delimiter
/// nesting **token by token**, so a `{` or `}` buried inside a block string must never
/// reach it as a separate token — otherwise a brace inside a string literal would
/// perturb the depth counter and mis-place a recovery sync point. See
/// [`sync_balanced`](crate::InputRef::sync_balanced) for the counter this leans on.
///
/// ## Trivia surfacing
///
/// A lexer either **surfaces** every trivia byte as a real token or **skips** it at the
/// lexer level. [`SURFACES_TRIVIA`](Self::SURFACES_TRIVIA) declares which — defaulting to
/// the token vocabulary's own [`Token::SURFACES_TRIVIA`], the totality half of the trivia
/// concept whose per-token identity half is [`Token::is_trivia`]. Declaring `true` promises
/// *totality*: every source byte is covered by either an emitted token (trivia included) or
/// a reported lexer error, none silently discarded. The lossless (`gap_kind`)
/// [`Sink`](crate::cst::Sink) requires it at **compile time**; declaring it while a
/// lexer-level `skip` rule discards bytes anyway is the unspecified-but-bounded violation
/// class below — surfaced by materialization as
/// [`UncoveredGap`](crate::cst::FinishError::UncoveredGap), never UB or a panic from this
/// crate.
///
/// ## Violation posture
///
/// A lexer that breaks a clause above is **not** undefined behavior and **not**
/// memory-unsafe. The input layer's behavior under a violating lexer is
/// **unspecified but bounded**, exactly the posture a misused checkpoint gets (see
/// [`restore`](crate::InputRef::restore)'s release-build section): no undefined
/// behavior, no leak, no panic originating in this crate, and — because a resource
/// limiter's tally travels inside the checkpointed `State` — every scan still
/// terminates. What is *not* guaranteed is that a replay matches the original run:
/// diagnostics may be missing or misattributed, and the replayed token stream may
/// differ. Debug builds turn the one locally-checkable clause (nonempty spans) into an
/// assertion at the single lexing chokepoint.
