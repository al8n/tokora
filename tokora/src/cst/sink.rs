//! The rewindable event sink: [`Sink`] wraps any inner emitter, buffers the CST event
//! stream, and rewinds it under the **same** mark that rewinds diagnostics — one timeline,
//! every channel (see the [`event`](super::event) module for the vocabulary and its laws).
//!
//! # CELL_CENSUS — every mutable cell of the sink, and its class
//!
//! The input layer's cell taxonomy (see `input::lineage`) governs the sink's cells too: a
//! new cell lands here classified, or [`census`] fails to compile. The classes:
//!
//! | # | Cell | Class | Rewind/restore semantics |
//! |---|------|-------|--------------------------|
//! | E1 | [`Sink::events`] | **ground truth** (a second emission log) | append + suffix-truncate to the mark — the same two verbs as `Verbose`'s log (plus the one censused prefix-preserving splice of the hole wrap, entirely above every live mark) |
//! | E2 | [`Sink::journal`] | **undo journal** (the Verbose-parallel-maps discipline lifted to events) | rewind pops entries written above the mark, reverse order, restoring each overwritten `forward_parent`; never grows on rewind |
//! | E3 | [`Sink::ledger`] | **monotone era source + truncation witness** | rewind APPENDS to it (a rewind *is* a truncation) and never removes; rewinding it would false-accept a stale mark |
//! | E4 | [`Sink::rows`] | **release stack + per-checkpoint depth ledger + inner reading** | push at `checkpoint()` (freezing the depth and the inner emitter's own checkpoint reading), pop at `release()` (kept) and `rewind()` (spent, the popped row's inner reading is the inner's rewind target); depth entries are frozen facts about prefixes, never live counters |
//! | — | [`Sink::floor`] | derived memo (the newest released row) | reset to the surviving top row when a rewind drops below it |
//! | — | [`Sink::base_inner`] | derived memo (the inner's construction-time reading) | primed at the first advancing touch (provably the construction reading), never restored (the exact no-row target at the origin only) |
//! | — | `inner`, `mapper`, `error_kind`, `gap_kind`, `trivia` | configuration / the wrapped emitter | never touched by rewind (the inner rewinds through its own contract) |
//! | — | `witness` | sink identity (validated at every mark spend, every build) | never restored |
//!
//! Open-node **depth is derived, never cached**: there is no live depth counter anywhere —
//! [`checkpoint`](Emitter::checkpoint) snapshots a frozen per-row depth, and every query
//! recounts the suffix above the nearest frozen fact. A cached counter would need its own
//! restore rule; a derived one is restored by truncation for free.

/// [`SeparatedEmitter`] and its four leading/trailing refinements), and [`PrattEmitter`] —
/// so any context bound satisfied by `E` is satisfied by `Sink<E>`. It exposes the inner
/// emitter by shared reference only ([`inner_ref`](Self::inner_ref)); there is **no** `&mut`
/// accessor, because a caller who could rewind the inner emitter directly would shear the
/// event log from the diagnostic log with no witness. Materialization
/// ([`finish`](Self::finish) / [`finish_partial`](Self::finish_partial)) consumes the sink
/// and returns the inner emitter with the tree.
///
/// # Inner-emitter contract: value-keyed checkpoint readings
///
/// The sink composes with its wrapped emitter through checkpoint *readings*, never mark
/// *resources*: [`checkpoint`](Emitter::checkpoint) captures `inner.checkpoint()` onto the
/// mark-stack row as a plain `u64` fact, [`rewind`](Emitter::rewind) hands a captured reading
/// back to `inner.rewind`, and [`release`](Emitter::release) pops the sink's own row **without
/// forwarding** — the inner is never told about kept branches. The wrapped emitter must
/// therefore be **value-keyed**, the trait's reference shape
/// ([`Verbose`](crate::emitter::Verbose), [`Fatal`](crate::emitter::Fatal),
/// [`Silent`](crate::emitter::Silent), [`Ignored`](crate::utils::marker::Ignored), and every
/// `Verbose`-shaped collector): `checkpoint` is a pure monotone reading of the emission state
/// (no per-call allocation), `rewind` restores by value — reclaiming everything above the
/// mark as a range — and `release` needs nothing forwarded, because a kept reading is just a
/// number going out of scope. The reading is a fact about the inner's one emission timeline,
/// whichever `Lang` instantiation reads it (the trait's one-timeline law). The sink hands
/// `inner.rewind` only readings it knows exactly — a row's capture, or the construction-time
/// base for a full unwind to the origin; a rewind that truncates nothing never touches the
/// inner, and a truncating rewind to a mid-log mark no row captured is witnessed in debug and
/// leaves the inner untouched in release (the sink never fabricates a reading).
///
/// A table-keyed emitter — one that allocates per-`checkpoint` bookkeeping behind interior
/// mutability and reclaims it per-`release` — is **not supported as the inner**: the sink
/// re-spends its base reading across no-row **origin** rewinds, drops row readings above a rewound
/// target by value, and settles rows out of stack order under mixed raw use, all of which
/// presuppose readings. Such an emitter belongs at the input layer's direct seam, where the
