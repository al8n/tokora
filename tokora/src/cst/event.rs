//! The event vocabulary of the rewindable CST channel: the flat log a
//! [`CstEmitter`] records into, and the branded marks that make
//! retro-parenting safe under backtracking.
//!
//! # The two verbs
//!
//! An event buffer changes in exactly two ways: **append** (the `cst_*` emission methods) and
//! **suffix-truncate** (an emitter [`rewind`](crate::emitter::Emitter::rewind)). No operation
//! rewrites the *kind* of an interior slot — retro-parenting is expressed by **appending** a
//! `StartAt` that names an earlier tombstone, never by completing the
//! tombstone in place. This is what makes rewind-by-truncation exact: the prefix below any
//! live mark is immutable, so truncating to the mark restores the buffer to precisely the
//! state it had when the mark was captured. (The one journaled exception is the
//! `forward_parent` *acceleration* field a `StartAt` writes back onto its
//! target tombstone; the sink's undo journal reverse-replays those writes on rewind, so the
//! law holds observationally — see `Sink` under the `rowan` feature.)
//!
//! # The depth model
//!
//! Balance is *derived* from the buffer, never cached beside it:
//!
//! - `StartNode` with a real kind opens a node: **+1**;
//! - `StartNode` with the [`TOMBSTONE`] kind is an inert mark: **0**;
//! - `StartAt` opens a retro-wrap (hoisted to its target at
//!   materialization): **+1** at its own index;
//! - `FinishNode` closes the innermost open node: **−1**;
//! - `Token` and `Diag` are neutral: **0**.
//!
//! Both verbs preserve "every prefix has depth ≥ 0 or is diagnosed at materialization": a
//! malformed buffer is representable (the raw `cst_*` surface is sharp), but it is
//! *unrepresentable as a successful materialization* — `finish` walks the log and returns a
//! typed error instead of building a wrong tree.
//!
//! # Marks carry eras
//!
//! Truncate-and-regrow is the normal backtracking rhythm, so "the index is in bounds" says
//! nothing about whether the event at that index is still the one a mark was issued for. An
//! [`EventMark`] therefore pairs its buffer index with the **era** of the truncation history
//! at issue time — and with the **identity** of the issuing sink, because eras are per-sink
//! histories and two sinks' `(index, era)` pairs coincide trivially. The recording sink keeps
//! a monotone era source and a truncation ledger (`TruncationLedger`) that restore never
//! rewinds, and validates every spend. A stale or foreign mark **panics in every build** —
//! the savepoint posture: both are parser bugs, not input-dependent conditions, and the
//! silent alternative is a wrong tree with no witness.
