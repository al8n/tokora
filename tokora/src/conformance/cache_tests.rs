//! Tests that prove the cache conformance kit: the four built-in caches pass every check, a
//! correct third-party queue passes too, and each deliberately-broken queue trips exactly the
//! check that owns its defect — with the two exceptions below, which are labelled rather than
//! left to look like the rest.
//!
//! The broken fixtures are one `Queue` type with a const-selected defect, so the defects sit side
//! by side and adding one is three lines rather than a new file.
//!
//! Two fixtures are not defects-under-test and say so at their definitions. `OVERFILL_TRIPWIRE`
//! asserts on the **kit's** driver rather than on a cache, pinning the fact that `peek` is
//! reached with a buffer that is not empty. `TOTAL_CAPACITY_PEEK` is a defect the kit provably
//! cannot see, and its test asserts the kit **accepts** it — an inverted test that keeps the
//! module docs' "what it deliberately does not check" section honest by failing if that ever
//! stops being true.

//
// Four review rounds of #183 found the same defect four times: a value a `Cache` method handed
// the kit that the kit reduced to `is_ok()`/`is_some()` and never compared. R1 a popped entry,
// R2 the same on the peek-then-consume path, R3 every accepted push's `Ok` reference, R4/R5 the
// `Err` of a refusal at the two sites where a refusal may be either warranted or not.
//
// Each round the fix was correct and each round the *method* was the same: enumerate the sites
// by hand and argue the residue is fine. Four hand enumerations, four misses. The enumeration by
// **shape** was complete — `Some` / `None` / `Ok` / `Err`-expected / `Err`-unexpected, and there
// is no sixth — but the enumeration by **site** was not, because a site can be two shapes at
// once and a census organised by shape cannot see that.
//
// So this is the guard that replaces the argument: a mechanical scan of the kit's own source
// that fails, naming the function and line, the moment a `Cache` call appears anywhere it is not
// registered below. It cannot prove a value is compared — Rust has no call-site reflection, and
// `RECORD_CENSUS` and `SETTLE_CENSUS` live with the same limit — but it makes the *existence* of
// a site impossible to overlook, which is the step that kept failing.

/// expression list, and expands to `cache.pop_front()`. #183's eighth round found exactly that,

/// to come from a closed list is enforceable, and then "a guarded call appears literally in the
/// source" is a wall rather than a caveat.
///
/// The admission criterion is one property, and it is the reason walking the *body* is sound for
/// everything here: **the expansion adds no call the author chose.** Stated that precisely on
/// purpose — "adds no call at all" would be wider than what holds, and a census whose own
/// justification overclaims is #183's defect one level in. These macros do add calls: `assert_eq!`
/// inserts `PartialEq::eq`, the `format_args!` family inserts `Display::fmt`. But which calls they
/// add is fixed by std, not by what is written at the invocation, and none is a `Cache` method. So
/// every *guarded* call in the expansion is one that appears literally in the tokens, which is
/// exactly what the walk reads. A user macro chooses its own expansion, which is why none is
/// admitted.

// ── Dense but finite: what the ceiling must not conflate with nontermination ─────────
//
// The guard above stops a lexer that never reaches the target. The ceiling it stops at was
// justified by "monotone progress and nonempty spans bound a conforming lexer at one item per
// source unit" — which is not what the contract enforced elsewhere says. Starts must be
// NON-DECREASING, not strictly increasing, and spans must be INDIVIDUALLY nonempty, not disjoint,
// so repeated and overlapping items are legal and a finite terminating lexer may emit many items
// per unit. This kit does not even check that much: it drives the raw lexer and never runs the
// lexer-contract tier.
//
// So the number was an assumption wearing a derivation's clothes, and a lexer that merely emits a
// lot per unit was refused as nonterminating with no way to say otherwise. The two cells below are
// the same lexer at the same density under the two ceilings.

/// Lexer errors this fixture emits at each position before the token there.
///
/// Chosen so `want` tokens cost more than the default ceiling over [`DENSE_SRC`] and comfortably
/// less than the raised one, which is what makes the pair of cells below say something.

/// A **finite, deterministic, terminating** lexer that emits [`DENSE_ERRORS_PER_TOKEN`] errors at

///
/// Every error reports the same nonempty span as the token that follows it — legal, since the
/// contract asks for non-decreasing starts rather than strictly increasing ones — and the token
/// carries its own slice, so the corpus stays pairwise distinct on all three axes and the kit's
/// comparisons keep their discriminating power.
