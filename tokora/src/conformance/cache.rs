//! Conformance test kit for custom [`Cache`] implementations.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `Cache::rewind` used to be part of this trait, and it could not be implemented correctly from
//! what it was given: the method received a `&Checkpoint`, whose public surface is the cursor and
//! the state, while the datum its own documentation named — which entries were pushed after the
//! save — is crate-private. A third-party implementation had no way to be right, and one that
//! tried over-dropped pre-save lookahead: the region then re-lexes, so limit budgets are
//! re-burnt, instrumentation doubles, and poison can latch at a position the original lineage
//! never reached.
//!
//! So the method is gone and the geometry moved into the input layer, which has both halves of
//! the facts. What is left for a cache to uphold is a **queue contract** — and a contract that
//! only exists as prose is a contract nobody can check. This kit is its executable form: build a
//! [`CacheHarness`] over a source your lexer can read and call [`run`](CacheHarness::run). It
//! panics, with precise context, on the first violation.
//!
//! # What it checks
//!
//! The kit's fundamental observable is the **cached entry** — the triple
//! (`L::Span`, `L::Token`, `L::State`) that a [`CachedToken`] carries. Wherever a check reads an
//! entry back out of a cache — through `front`, `back`, `pop_front`, `pop_back`, `peek`,
//! `peek_one`, the token a refused push hands back, `push_many`'s overflow, or the entry a
//! `pop_front_if` predicate is given — all three components are compared, componentwise, against
//! what the kit stored at that position, each with its own message.
//!
//! The `L::State` half is the one with teeth. It is what the input layer restores a lexer
//! **from**: `InputRef::lexer` rebuilds the lexer at the lookahead frontier out of the state the
//! newest retained entry carries ([`crate::Lexer::with_state`] + [`crate::Lexer::bump`]), and
//! the rollback path reads the same field off the entries
//! `pop_back` hands out. A cache that returns the right spans beside the wrong states does not
//! merely fail to be certified: until #183 it **passed**, in full, and then corrupted every
//! restore that resumed from it.
//!
//! Each check is one law from the [`Cache`] trait contract:
//!
//! 1. **Empty invariants** — a fresh cache is empty on every observable at once: `len` 0,
//!    `is_empty`, no `front`/`back`, nothing to pop, no `span`, an empty `peek`.
//! 2. **`RETAINS_FRONT` honesty** — a cache that declares `true` must accept a `push_front` into
//!    an empty cache: both into a *fresh* one, where that push is the first operation the cache
//!    ever sees, and into one that has been used and emptied. (The input layer compiles its
//!    parked-slot fallback *out* on that declaration, so a cache that declares it and then
//!    refuses is losing tokens.) The *law* underneath — an empty cache with capacity accepts a
//!    front push, because a push is refused only by a full one — belongs to check 5 and is driven
//!    for **every** nonzero capacity whatever the declaration says. What this check adds is what
//!    the declaration costs.
//! 3. **FIFO append and exact length** — `push_back` places each token after every resident one;
//!    `len` is exactly the resident count and `remaining` exactly how many more `push_back`s will
//!    be accepted, at every step; and a refused push **returns the token unchanged** and leaves
//!    every observable untouched. `is_empty` is checked against the same residency here too, not
//!    only at check 1's fresh cache: `is_empty` is a *default* method (`len() == 0`) a fixture
//!    can override, and check 1 alone only ever calls it where `len` has already established the
//!    answer is `true` — a constant-`true` override was otherwise indistinguishable from a
//!    correct one at every OTHER residency this kit drives.
//! 4. **Order** — `pop_front` removes the oldest and `pop_back` the newest, and `front`/`back`
//!    view those same two entries without removing them. The input layer's restore path is built
//!    on the `pop_back` half. `front`/`back` are read **themselves**, at every residency the kit
//!    builds, and not only through `front_span`/`back_span`: those two are *default* methods
//!    derived from these, but a cache is free to specialize them off a head and tail index, and
//!    then the entry a caller reads — the one carrying the token and the `L::State` a restore
//!    resumes from — can name a different slot than the span accessor does.
//! 5. **`push_front` prepends** — before every resident entry, with the same refusal
//!    round-trip, and the same requirement that a refusal be **warranted**: a push is refused
//!    only by a full cache, on this arm exactly as on `push_back`'s. The prepend order is
//!    checked in **full**, not at its two ends: the resident sequence is drained after each
//!    accepted prefix — from the front, and then from the back, since every other `pop_back` the
//!    kit drives runs against a cache `push_back` filled from empty, and a tail index a prepend
//!    invalidated is wrong only on a residency a prepend built — because a `push_front` that
//!    lands its token at the front and permutes what
//!    is behind it has the right front, the right back and the right length. The two arms are
//!    also **interleaved**, not run one after the other: a mixed residency built as one
//!    `push_back` and then every `push_front` never once puts an append after a prepend, so a
//!    cache whose append computes its slot from a head index a prepend has since moved is
//!    correct in every sequence the rest of the kit builds. And the refusal law
//!    is driven at the **empty** cache too, at every nonzero capacity — the one state the
//!    prepend driver cannot reach, because it has to seed the cache with a `push_back` before
//!    there is anything to prepend before. And it is driven at **capacity 1**, where the seeding
//!    push fills the cache and so every front push after it is refused: the prepend order is not
//!    observable at that capacity, but the refusal is the only thing observable there, and no
//!    other check reaches a refused push on this arm — check 3 drives the round-trip for
//!    `push_back`, and the two accepted-front-push checks never see one refused.
//! 6. **Bounded, pure `peek`** — appends exactly `min(len, the buffer's REMAINING capacity at
//!    call time)` entries, oldest first, each resident token once, leaving whatever the buffer
//!    already held untouched; changes no observable; and answers identically when called twice
//!    on an unchanged cache. Driven against an empty buffer *and* against a prefilled one — both
//!    are real. Remaining and total capacity are the same number only while the buffer is empty,
//!    which is what the real call site hands over on a cache hit or an overflow-free fill;
//!    otherwise it hands over a prefilled one, already holding the parked token or staged
//!    overflow. The prefilled driver sweeps **every prefix
//!    depth** the window can hold, from one entry to a buffer with no room left, rather than
//!    fixing one: at a single depth a `peek` that is correct behind that prefix and wrong behind
//!    a deeper one is indistinguishable from a conforming one. The whole of it is driven at
//!    **every residency**, from a full cache down to one drained empty, since at
//!    `len == capacity` a `peek` bounded by the backing store and a `peek` bounded by the live
//!    run are the same number — and each residency is reached from **both ends**, by
//!    `pop_front` and by `pop_back`, since removed entries a cache fails to clear sit ahead of
//!    the live run on the first path and behind it on the second, and only the sweep that drains
//!    that end reads them. `pop_back` is the input layer's restore path. The whole of it is then
//!    driven once more against **one instance**, peeked in full and then popped and re-peeked at
//!    every residency down to empty — because a sweep that builds a fresh cache per residency
//!    only ever asks a cache its FIRST question, and a `peek` that memoises its first answer and
//!    serves it after later pops is pure, is correct at the residency it latched, and is
//!    otherwise invisible. Those pops are the only ones in the kit that run on an already-peeked
//!    instance, so the **entry** each of them returns is compared there too: a `peek` that leaves
//!    a cached lookahead frontier behind and lets a later pop report its `L::State` out of that
//!    instead of out of the entry it removed keeps every span and every residency correct, and
//!    hands the caller a lexer position no entry ever had. And the bound and order are read through **three window types**, not
//!    one: `peek` is generic over `W` and may read `W::CAPACITY` off it, so a single fixed window
//!    leaves a branch on that parameter unreachable — the single-slot fast path the trait invites
//!    (`peek_one`'s default body is `peek::<U1>`), and the truncating path a cache takes when the
//!    residency does not fit in the window, which never runs while the window is as wide as every
//!    residency driven. Sweeping the prefill depth does not stand in for this: that varies the
//!    room LEFT in the buffer, not the type. The prefilled half is also driven with the buffer's
//!    entries **before** the residency in source order, not only after it: that relation was one
//!    fixed value in every prefilled call the kit made, and the value it was fixed at is the
//!    inverse of the real one — the peek fill pushes the parked token first, because the parked
//!    token is the front of the stream. Both are now driven, and they catch different things: a
//!    `peek` that sorts or merges the buffer by span is caught by the *later* arrangement, where
//!    a correct append leaves the buffer unsorted, and a `peek` that reads the buffer as a prefix
//!    of its own run and skips an entry it decides the caller already holds can only act in the
//!    *earlier* one. `peek_one` agrees with
//!    `front`, answers nothing where there is no front, and — like `peek` — answers **the same
//!    on a second call** against an unchanged cache: it takes `&self`, so the two calls are the
//!    same question.
//! 7. **`clear`** — returns the cache to the check-1 state, AND the cache stays usable
//!    afterward: it is refilled with `cap` fresh pushes and checked against check 3's oracle,
//!    so a `clear` that empties the cache but also permanently disables it (poisons it, zeroes
//!    its capacity) does not pass by never being asked to accept another token.
//! 8. **`span`** — the combined span runs from the front entry's start to the back entry's end,
//!    swept at every residency check 6 sweeps (full, and partially drained from both ends), not
//!    checked once against a freshly filled cache: a `span` that is correct immediately after a
//!    fill and stale after any pop is indistinguishable from a conforming one at the one
//!    residency a single check reaches.
//!
//!    Checks 6 and 8 are then both re-run against a **rotated** residency — drained off the front
//!    and topped back up to capacity — because those two are the operations that WALK from the
//!    head, and a ring's live run only ever wraps past the end of its backing array when
//!    something is pushed *after* something was popped. Every other residency the kit builds
//!    starts from an empty cache and only shrinks, so the classic missing `% capacity` truncates
//!    by zero at all of them. `front`, `back` and the pops name a single slot rather than walking
//!    to one, and an index that names the wrong slot is already caught by the residency oracle.
//! 9. **`pop_front_if` / `try_pop_front_if`** — the predicate sees the front entry and nothing
//!    else; a `false` (or `Err`) answer removes nothing and leaves every observable untouched; a
//!    `true` (or `Ok(())`) answer removes exactly the front entry, matching what a bare
//!    `pop_front` would return from an identically filled cache. Against an empty cache, both
//!    answer `None` and the predicate never runs at all — there is no front to hand it. The
//!    predicate's **argument** is recorded and compared at **every arm that runs it** — both
//!    methods, and the DECLINING answer as well as the accepting one. It took two findings to get
//!    there. The two `try_pop_front_if` closures used to throw the argument away, so everything
//!    the check asserted about that method was its return value and its residency. Then the
//!    `pop_front_if` arm driven with a `false` predicate turned out to do the same, because a
//!    site that answers `None` had been filed under "absence is the law" — a classification made
//!    on what the call RETURNS, when what makes these two methods different is that they hand an
//!    entry to caller code BEFORE they know what to return. Either way an override that ran the
//!    caller's validation predicate against `back()` and then produced the conforming return and
//!    the conforming residency satisfied all of it. That is a cache whose caller-supplied
//!    predicate decides whether to remove or retain the front on the strength of unrelated
//!    lookahead, certified by a check whose own prose named the property it was not testing.
//! 10. **`push_many`** — accepts tokens in order until the cache is full, then hands the
//!     remainder back through the returned iterator, unchanged and in the order they arrived.
//!
//! The kit adapts to capacity: it runs every check a cache of that capacity can express, so the
//! capacity-0 `()` cache, the capacity-1 `Option` cache and an arbitrarily wide ring are all
//! driven by the same call.
//!
//! **Both constructors.** `Cache` has two — [`new`](Cache::new) and
//! [`with_options`](Cache::with_options) — and the kit builds with the first. Hand it
//! [`also_built_by`](CacheHarness::also_built_by) and it runs the whole contract a second time
//! against caches the second one builds, re-reading the capacity from each pass so the two may
//! differ, and tagging every message with which constructor it is talking about. It cannot reach
//! `with_options` on its own: [`Options`](Cache::Options) is an associated type the kit has no
//! way to fabricate a value of.
//!
//! # What it deliberately does not check
//!
//! **Whether `with_options` honours the options it was given.** The pass above certifies that a
//! `with_options`-built cache obeys the whole contract, which is what catches the shapes that
//! matter — one that comes back non-empty, or that reports a capacity it will not honour. What
//! no oracle generic over `L` and `C` can check is the *relation* between the options and the
//! cache: `Options` is opaque, so a `with_options(16)` that hands back a capacity-3 cache is
//! internally consistent, and internally consistent is all the kit can see. That relation is the
//! implementor's to test, in a test that knows what the options mean.
//!
//! **The zero-re-scan law** (a probed closer is committed exactly once, cache-independently, in
//! any capacity) is an *input-layer* law, not a queue law: its oracle drives `probe_close` and
//! `commit_probed`, which are crate-internal, and reaching it through public API needs a
//! delimited grammar that a kit generic over `L` cannot synthesize. It is covered in-tree
//! instead, at the mechanism level and through the `separated` driver, over capacities 0, 1, 3
//! and 8 — see `commit_probed_lexes_the_closer_once_under_every_cache` and
//! `tests/probe_close_no_rescan.rs`. Said here rather than implied by omission.
//!
//! **A `peek` bounded by the buffer's TOTAL capacity, when it discards the overflow in
//! silence.** Check 6 states the bound as the buffer's *remaining* capacity and drives it with a
//! prefilled buffer, which is the only shape where remaining and total differ at all — but a
//! cache that reads the wrong one and then simply ignores what `push_back` hands back is
//! **provably invisible** to this kit, and to any caller of the `Cache` trait.
//!
//! Two facts make it so. `ArrayDeque::push_back` on a full deque returns the value and
//! leaves the deque *unmodified*, so an over-count leaves no trace in the buffer; and the
//! arithmetic collapses — with `W` the buffer's capacity, `P` what it already holds and
//! `R = W - P` the room left, a `peek` that pushes the oldest `min(len, W)` entries in order
//! lands `min(min(len, W), R) = min(len, R)` of them, which is the correct count, in the correct
//! order, for **every** `len`, `W` and `P`. No window size, prefill depth or cache capacity the
//! kit could choose separates the two, `peek` takes `&self` so there is no residency to differ,
//! and the surplus entries are dropped inside the cache where the kit has no hook. There is
//! nothing left to assert on.
//!
//! So the kit does not claim to catch it. What it does claim, and checks, is the observable half
//! of the same law: a `peek` that **writes over** the entries the buffer already held, rather
//! than appending behind them, fails check 6 — that one has a consequence, and the prefilled
//! driver is what exposes it. `cache_tests.rs` pins both halves: one fixture that the kit
//! catches, and one silent total-capacity fixture that the kit is asserted to **accept**, so
//! this paragraph stops being true the moment that assertion starts failing.
//!
//! **What an empty cache's `pop_front_if`/`try_pop_front_if` predicate is SHOWN, if it wrongly
//! runs at all.** These two methods are the only ones on `Cache` that hand an entry to caller
//! code, and they do it before they know what to return — so for them a `None` return is not
//! evidence that nothing was handed over. Every arm the kit drives against a *non-empty* cache
//! therefore records the predicate's argument and compares it, the declining arm included. The
//! two empty-cache probes do not: their law is that the predicate must **never run**, which is
//! asserted directly, and a cache that runs one has already failed on the louder violation. What
//! the kit does not then say is which entry it conjured to run it with. No cache is certified
//! because of this — reaching the case requires failing the check — and it is written down here
//! rather than left implied, because the round that closed the declining arm found it by
//! noticing that exactly this sentence had never been written for it.
//!
//! **The non-panicking restore path** cannot be checked by running code: the input layer calls
//! `pop_front`, `pop_back`, `clear`, `front`, `front_span` and `len` from guard drops that may
//! run mid-unwind, where a panic aborts the process. A test cannot survive its own witness. The
//! law is on the trait; this kit exercises those six operations so a panicking one fails *here*,
//! in a test, rather than in a consumer's rollback.
//!
//! **A permutation of entries that are equal to begin with.** Every oracle compares the whole
//! entry — span, token and state — so a *substitution*, an entry that differs from the one the
//! kit stored at that position, is always caught. What no comparison can see is a permutation of
//! values that were already indistinguishable. The kit's discrimination is therefore exactly the
//! **pairwise distinctness of the tokens and the states your corpus carries**.
//!
//! Spans are pairwise distinct from every source, because `corpus` lexes successive items and
//! successive items occupy successive positions — so the ordering laws never lose discrimination,
//! whatever the kit is pointed at. Tokens and states are not free that way. A corpus of one
//! fieldless token variant has one inhabitant, so a token comparison over it is vacuous; a lexer
//! whose `L::State` is `()` — which is every logos `Extras` that was not given one — makes the
//! state comparison vacuous in the same way.
//!
//! A constant state is not a gap for **that** lexer: a single-valued state has nothing to be
//! re-associated with, so a cache cannot corrupt it. It is a gap for a cache **intended for
//! stateful lexers** and certified under a stateless one, which is the one combination this
//! paragraph exists to warn about. Certify such a cache under a corpus whose tokens and states
//! are pairwise distinct — see [`new`](CacheHarness::new) — and the entry comparison discriminates
//! every re-association a cache can make.
//!
//! # Violation posture
//!
//! A failing check is a bug in the *cache* (or a mismatch with the documented contract),
//! surfaced loudly. The kit never mutates behaviour; it observes and asserts.

  // ── every value a `Cache` method hands back is read, not counted ─────────────────
  //
  // A value reduced to `is_ok()`/`is_some()` is a value the kit did not check, and #183's own
  // review found that class twice in two rounds — first a pop whose entry was discarded
  // (`check_peek_across_mutations`), then a push whose returned reference was (every push in the
  // kit). Both were invisible for the same reason: everything downstream observes **storage**,
  // and neither the popped entry nor the returned reference is storage.
  //
  // So the class is closed rather than the occurrences — and closed by ENUMERATION, not by
  // looking harder, which is the difference between a class that is finished and one that keeps
  // producing findings. A `Cache` method returns an `Option` or a `Result`, so there are exactly
  // four shapes a value can arrive in, and every one of them is now accounted for:
  //
  //   * `Option::Some`  — compared, through the entry comparison below.
  //   * `Option::None`  — presence-only, at twelve sites, because **absence is the law under
  //                       test**: a drained cache that must not answer, an empty cache that must
  //                       not answer. Nothing came back, so presence is not a weaker check there
  //                       — it is the whole check. Each carries a comment at the site.
  //
  //                       That bound is on the RETURN, and #183's ninth round found it being
  //                       read as a bound on the CALL. `pop_front_if` and `try_pop_front_if` —
  //                       the only two `Cache` methods that run CALLER CODE, which is a closed
  //                       list read off the trait rather than an inspection of this file — hand
  //                       an entry over *before* they learn what to return. A `None` therefore
  //                       says nothing about what the predicate was shown, and check 9's
  //                       DECLINING arm is compared rather than counted for exactly that
  //                       reason: it used to sit in this bullet, and a cache could answer
  //                       `None`, remove nothing, keep every span in place, and still run the
  //                       caller's validation predicate against an entry it never held there.
  //
  //                       The two empty-cache probes stay in this bullet on a different footing
  //                       and are sound: their law is that the predicate must NOT RUN at all,
  //                       asserted directly beside them, so on any conforming path nothing is
  //                       handed to anyone. A cache that runs one anyway fails on the run, the
  //                       louder violation; what it was shown is then not compared, which is
  //                       claim accuracy and not a certification any cache can pass.
  //   * `Result::Ok`    — compared, by [`checked_push`](Self::checked_push).
  //   * `Result::Err`   — compared. At the sites that drive a refusal ON PURPOSE (checks 3 and 5)
  //                       the caller compares it in its own round-trip wording; at the sites that
  //                       expected acceptance,
  //                       [`unexpected_refusal`](Self::unexpected_refusal) compares it before the
  //                       refusal panic can discard it.
  //
  // There is no fifth shape. But an enumeration by shape is not an enumeration by SITE, and that
  // is where four review rounds in a row went wrong: a single call site can be two shapes at
  // once — checks 3 and 5 each have one `push_back`/`push_front` whose `Err` is *sometimes*
  // legitimate and sometimes not — so an enumeration organised by shape classified them once, as
  // "expected refusal", and never saw the other branch.
  //
  // So the account above is no longer the guarantee. `CACHE_CALL_CENSUS` in `cache_tests.rs` is:
  // it parses this file and fails, naming the function and the line, the moment a call to any of
  // these methods appears at a site its table does not know about. Adding a call somewhere new
  // is a red test, not a missed review comment. The helpers below exist so that the registered
  // sites are few and each one's disposition is obvious at the call.

  /// The `Ok` arm of an accepted push, compared against the entry that was offered.
  ///
  /// [`Cache::push_back`] and [`Cache::push_front`] both promise `Ok` with **a reference to the
  /// cached token**, so that reference is a contract value like any other — and until #183's
  /// second review round every push in this kit reduced it to `is_ok()`. A cache can store the

    // `peeked_spans` above always starts from a fresh, empty buffer, where the buffer's
    // remaining capacity and its total capacity are the same number. That shape is real too —
    // `InputRef`'s peek fill (`peek/mod.rs`) hands `cache.peek` an empty `buf` on a cache hit or
    // an overflow-free fill, whenever nothing is parked — but it is not the only one: on the
    // paths that reach the call with a token parked, or with lexed overflow staged ahead of it,
    // the peek fill has already pushed that entry before it calls in, so `buf` can already hold
    // entries by the time `peek` sees it, with less room left than its total. Re-run the law in
    // that shape too.
    //
    // What this shape buys, precisely, is the APPEND half: `peek` writes behind what is already
    // in the buffer and leaves it alone. Against an empty buffer a `peek` that clears it first,
    // or that treats it as an output slot to fill rather than a queue to extend, is
    // indistinguishable from a correct one; here it is not.
    //
    // What it does NOT buy — stated here because the arithmetic is not obvious and the module
    // docs' "does not check" section owes the reader the same warning at the top of the file: a
    // `peek` bounded by the buffer's TOTAL capacity that pushes the oldest entries in order and
    // silently discards what `push_back` refuses lands exactly the entries a correct one would,
    // in every configuration. `min(min(len, W), W - P) == min(len, W - P)`, and a refused
    // `ArrayDeque::push_back` returns the value and leaves the deque untouched. That
    // defect has no observable consequence through the `Cache` surface at all, so no assertion
    // below is aimed at it.
    //
    // The prefill tokens are deliberately ones the cache is NOT holding. Prefilling with a token
    // the cache also has resident would let a `peek` that cleared the buffer and re-appended its
    // own run satisfy the untouched-prefix assertion by coincidence, since the buffer's first
    // entry and the cache's front would carry the same span.
    //
    // And the depth is swept rather than fixed. One prefilled entry is the shallowest buffer
    // that is not empty, so it separates append from overwrite — but nothing more: at depth 1
    // there is no prefix ORDER to disturb, the room left is the window all but one slot, and a
    // `peek` keyed on how much the buffer already holds reads the same on that call as a
    // conforming one. Every depth the window can hold is driven, up to and including the one
    // that leaves NO room at all, which is the only shape where the bound is asked to come out
