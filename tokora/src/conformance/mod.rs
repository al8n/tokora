//! Conformance test kit for custom [`Lexer`] implementations.
//!
//! tokora's input machinery (prefix replay after a checkpoint restore, cache
//! truncation, re-lexing a rewound region on demand) relies on the properties written
//! down in the [`Lexer`] contract. This module ships [`Harness`](crate::conformance::Harness),
//! a small builder that
//! **drives a lexer against that contract** and panics — with precise context — on the
//! first violation. It is a test tool: assert-with-context is the intended failure
//! mode, so custom-lexer authors run it from their own `#[test]`s.
//!
//! # What it checks
//!
//! **Trait tier** — driving the [`Lexer`] surface directly:
//!
//! 1. **Replay identity** — two fresh `L::new(src)` runs produce the identical
//!    token/error + span + slice sequence, to exhaustion. **Identical by value**: the whole
//!    [`Token`], the whole [`Token::Error`], never a rendering of either and never the token's
//!    [`kind`](Token::kind) standing in for the token. That is what
//!    [`run`](crate::conformance::Harness::run)'s two `PartialEq` bounds buy, and what a green
//!    from it did not mean before 0.10.0 — see `run`'s own docs for who pays.
//! 2. **State-resume faithfulness** — for *every* position `k`, capturing the lexer
//!    [`State`] there and resuming with
//!    `L::with_state(src, saved)` + [`bump`](crate::Lexer::bump) to `k`'s offset
//!    reproduces the original suffix from `k`. This is the prefix-replay assumption
//!    verbatim (position is threaded via `bump`, not encoded in `State`).
//! 3. **Monotone progress** — span starts are non-decreasing, every item's span is
//!    nonempty (`start < end`), and the run terminates within a generous multiple of
//!    the source length (an anti-hang guard so the kit itself never spins).
//! 4. **Sticky exhaustion** — after [`lex`](crate::Lexer::lex) returns `None`, further
//!    calls keep returning `None`; and the **span survives that exhaustion** —
//!    [`span`](crate::Lexer::span) keeps answering, well-formed, with the lexer's final
//!    position (at least the last item's end, at most the source length) and answers the same
//!    on every later call. The input layer reads that value at two sites, so an unspecified one
//!    is not academic: a `to`-shaped scan commits there at end of input, and the partial-input
//!    frontier reports `Incomplete(offset)` from it — the offset a refill driver resumes at.
//! 5. **Span / slice coherence** — every item's [`slice`](crate::Lexer::slice) equals
//!    the source over its [`span`](crate::Lexer::span), and spans lie within bounds.
//! 6. **Gap-free tiling** (optional, [`lossless`](crate::conformance::Harness::lossless)) — consecutive
//!    spans abut, the first starts at `0`, and the last ends at the source end. Off by
//!    default, since a syntactic lexer legitimately skips trivia.
//! 7. **Read-frontier purity** — [`read_frontier`](crate::Lexer::read_frontier) answers the same
//!    on every call within an item's window, and asking does not move the lexer. The *value* it
//!    reports is checked by the partial tier below, not here; this checks only that it is a read
//!    rather than a scan.
//!
//! **Integration tier** — driving an `Input` session through the machinery itself over
//! a fixed set of named, deterministic save/peek/drain/restore schedules
//! (`peek-heavy`, `save-early-restore-late`, `drain-then-restore-across-cache`,
//! `nested-savepoints`) and requiring every schedule to observe the layer the way the straight
//! drain did: the same **committed tokens** and the same **raised lexer errors**, both by value.
//! The straight drain's tokens are additionally required to equal the raw-lex tokens. No
//! randomness — the schedules are enumerated.
//!
//! The two arms are compared as two sequences rather than as one interleaved stream, and the
//! error arm is not cross-checked against the raw lexer. Both are facts about the input layer,
//! not weaker claims: a `peek` reports a refusal the moment it lexes the region, so where an
//! error sits *between* two committed tokens varies by schedule on a conforming lexer; and the
//! layer reports each refused region once, so a lexer that errors repeatedly over one span is
//! conforming while the layer raises one error. See `check_integration`.
//!
//! **Partial-input tier** (`run_partial`, a separate entry point for
//! `usize`-offset `str` / `[u8]` sources) — driving the input in
//! [`Partial`] mode over **every split point** and requiring
//! chunked-equivalence under the frontier rules: a non-final drain of each prefix yields a
//! **prefix of** the complete-parse items before the cut and always ends incomplete, while a
//! final drain of the whole source reproduces the complete parse **exactly**. Catches lexers that
//! are unfaithful under truncation (item identity depending on input beyond `(state, offset)`),
//! and it is what falsifies a wrong
//! [`read_frontier`](crate::Lexer::read_frontier) — including a wrong
//! [`SCAN_LOOKAHEAD`](crate::Token::SCAN_LOOKAHEAD) claim behind the logos
//! adapter.
//!
//! **Refill tier** (`run_refill`, the same `usize`-offset sources, plus a caller-supplied
//! [`RefillDriver`](crate::conformance::RefillDriver)) — carrying a
//! `(state, offset)` pair — the [lexer state](crate::state::State) and the position it was left at
//! — from the end of one buffer into a **grown** buffer and lexing on there, which is what a
//! refilling driver does and what neither tier above covers.
//! `run_partial` drives every prefix with a **fresh** lexer, so no `L::State` ever crosses a cut;
//! check 2 above carries state but resumes over the **same** source. The distinction is not *does
//! state survive* but ***does state survive a change of buffer***, and that is the mode
//! `Incomplete` exists for. It drives the [`Lexer`] surface directly —
//! [`with_state`](crate::Lexer::with_state) + [`bump`](crate::Lexer::bump) over a longer source —
//! because the input layer has no offset-resuming constructor to hand a carried state to, and each
//! leg is bounded by the same per-loop item budget the trait-tier checks carry, for the same
//! reason: the counter and the [`lex`](crate::Lexer::lex) call are in one loop body. What lives in
//! that gap is a lexer that forgets, at end of input, what it was in the middle of — a comment, a
//! string, a multi-byte prefix — and whose next buffer therefore starts in the wrong mode.
//!
//! The **cuts** are derived, as everywhere else here; the **buffers** are not, and cannot be. A
//! `L::Source` is `?Sized`, so the kit cannot own one, and every item a leg produces borrows its
//! slice for the corpus lifetime, so a buffer the kit allocated per leg could not outlive the leg
//! that made it. The caller therefore supplies a driver, which answers where one of its chunks may
//! end and what buffer that chunk lives in as **one** question — because the thing that produces
//! chunks is the thing that knows where a chunk may end. It is a required argument so that
//! [`SameAllocation`](crate::conformance::SameAllocation), which drives every leg over one buffer
//! and therefore tests a change of *length*, is a choice somebody wrote rather than a default they
//! inherited; and the run hands back a
//! [`RefillCoverage`](crate::conformance::RefillCoverage) so that a narrow chunk rule is a number
//! rather than a silence. Both shipped drivers derive their buffers by indexing the source, so both
//! are confined to a [`SemanticPrefix`](crate::conformance::SemanticPrefix) source — a sealed
//! promise, because a promise the kit cannot check is not one a caller may make on its behalf.
//! See [`run_refill`](crate::conformance::Harness::run_refill).
//!
//! What this tier will **not** drive is a refill past a **terminal** stop. A failing
//! [`Lexer::check`] is the crate's terminal predicate, and the input layer ranks it ahead of the
//! partial-input holdback: it emits the item, latches its poison boundary and never
//! refills, so the document ends there. A schedule reaching one therefore stops and certifies
//! nothing — the alternative would be to withhold the trip and re-lex it on a buffer production
//! never reaches, which is a pass for a transition that does not exist. Those schedules are counted
//! in the certificate, and an input made only of them is refused.
//!
//! Both tiers that drive an `Input` are bounded by a single non-rewindable counter per input,
//! `LexTally`, and not by the item budgets their drain loops also carry. The rule is that **a
//! budget bounds only the loops that increment it**: between a drain loop and the `Lexer::lex` call
//! sit `InputRef::next`/`peek` and the scanner's own loop, neither of which the kit owns, and the
//! input layer builds a fresh lexer for every one of those calls — so an item budget per drain and
//! an attempt ceiling per lexer instance are both restarted by a loop underneath them. The private
//! `LexTally` carries the full statement, the argument for why the tier entry is the last boundary
//! available, and why the counter cannot be refunded by a checkpoint restore.
//!
//! An **item** is a committed token *or* a lexer error the input layer raised, and both halves are
//! load-bearing: the layer lexes bytes and then either commits or refuses, and truncation can turn
//! one into the other. A tier that compared only tokens could not see the error arm at all — a
//! refusal leaves no token behind, so a lexer that errors on a truncated prefix and tokenizes the
//! full input showed up as "nothing yielded yet", which is a legal prefix.
//!
//! Both arms are compared on **value**, and this is the rule for *every* tier rather than for
//! this one: a token contributes its kind, its span and the **token itself**; an error contributes
//! that it *was* an error, its span and the **payload itself**. Not a rendering — both
//! `run` and `run_partial` ask for `PartialEq` on the token and the error and compare the values,
//! because a `Debug` string is neither injective (two payloads can render alike, so a real drift
//! passes) nor stable (a rendering carrying an address or a counter fails on a conforming lexer).
//! Comparing only the token's *kind* had the same shape on the other arm: a payload decided by a
//! byte that has not arrived kept its kind and its span, so both runs passed while the value a
//! parser callback receives changed. The trait tier held the weaker key for one release longer
//! than the partial tier did, and that gap was #269.
//!
//! Nothing from the *diagnostic* channel is compared: no rendered message, no
//! [`Severity`](crate::emitter::Severity), no label stack.
//!
//! The non-final leg asks for a *prefix*, not equality, because **over-withholding is sound**: a
//! lexer that reports reading past what it emits withholds more than the pre-0.10.0 span rule did,
//! and one that reports [`Unbounded`](crate::ReadFrontier::Unbounded) withholds everything until
//! the stream is sealed. Requiring equality would fail every conforming lookahead lexer. The final
//! leg is where full equality is pinned. That relaxation is also why the items have to carry
//! errors: once the length may legitimately be short, "withheld" and "reported and thrown away"
//! are the same observation, and only an arm the harness *records* can be told apart.
//!
//! # Violation posture
//!
//! A failing check is a bug in the *lexer* (or a mismatch with the documented
//! contract), surfaced loudly. The kit never mutates the lexer's behavior; it only
//! observes and asserts.
//!
//! **The kit reports exactly what it established — no more and no less.** Those are one rule with
//! two halves, and both halves are enforced in the machinery every comparison is built from
//! rather than at the sites that draw verdicts from it.
//!
//! **No more: it never reports a failure that is a fact about a value type rather than about the
//! lexer.** Every verdict here rests on an equality the kit does not own. [`PartialEq`] promises
//! symmetry and transitivity but **not** reflexivity, so a payload holding an `f64` that can be
//! `NaN` is not equal to itself — and [`Eq`] and [`Ord`] *do* promise reflexivity while nothing
//! checks the promise, so a `Kind`, a span, an offset or a source slice can break it too. The
//! guarded population is therefore **every** equality any tier draws a verdict from, and it is
//! defined by construction rather than by a list: a comparison is built by `compare_by`, its
//! answer names the **component that decided it**, and building it is the only way to reach either
//! a verdict or a refusal. Once such a comparison has already failed, the kit asks whether *that*
//! operation is equal to itself, and a side whose is not gets a refusal tagged
//! `non-reflexive-payload` naming the component and the obligation, instead of a verdict whose
//! expected-vs-got renders identically on both sides (#295). The obligation is unchanged and is
//! the caller's: such a type hand-writes the impl that says what equality means for it.
//!
//! **No less: it never withholds a verdict it did establish.** Some differences rest on no caller
//! equality at all — a difference at the **discriminant** (an item that is a lexer error on one
//! side and a committed token on the other) or in item **count** — and a component comparison over
//! two values that each equal themselves is sound too, which is the ordinary case and the whole
//! population of honest failures. All of those are **conclusive**, and a conclusive difference
//! outranks an inconclusive one wherever both are available: the first inconclusive difference is
//! retained as a fallback while the search continues into the remaining components of the item,
//! the later positions of the stream, the item count, and — where a law is decided by two whole
//! answers rather than by components — the second arm of the integration tier's observation and
//! the second half of a prefilled peek's buffer. It is reported only if nothing conclusive is
//! found anywhere. `Ranking` carries that rule and the argument for it.
//!
//! The search is bounded by one **verdict**, and that is the honest edge of it. Two checks under
//! two different tags are two laws, and the kit keeps its assert-with-context posture across
//! them: a refusal at replay identity ends the run without asking what state-resume would have
//! said. Widening that would make the harness accumulate failures instead of stopping at the
//! first, which is a different tool from the one this module says it is.
//!
//! Both halves were learned from the same failure, one direction at a time. Answering `false` and
//! then scanning the whole item for a non-reflexive value asked a different question from the one
//! the comparison had asked, and hid the truncation nonconformance the partial tier exists to
//! report behind a refusal saying the kit had convicted the lexer of nothing. Stopping at the
//! first difference reached hid a decisive item count behind a `NaN` at position 0, and a
//! corrupted `L::State` behind a `NaN` in the token beside it.

  /// - **The item guards go out of reach, and only those.** `out.len() > budget` cannot hold when
  ///   `budget` is `usize::MAX`, because no `Vec` holds that many items. This is the one guard the
  ///   old wording described correctly.
  /// - **The per-instance ceiling *overflows*.** It is `budget + 1`, so at `usize::MAX` it wraps
  ///   to `0` in release and panics with an arithmetic message in debug. A per-instance ceiling of
  ///   zero is not an inert guard — it refuses every lexer on its **first** attempt. The failure
  ///   is the opposite of the one the old wording named.
  /// - **The aggregate tally still fires.** It compares `spent >= limit` before it increments and
  ///   counts in `u128`, over a ceiling that is *derived* from the budget rather than equal to it.
  ///   So it is enforced — just at a number no run reaches while anybody is waiting, which is a
  ///   *useless* ceiling and not an absent one.
  ///
  /// None of the three is the reason the cap is a **refusal**. That reason is below, and it is a
  /// different problem again: it is about what a clamp does to a caller the kit accepts.
  ///
  /// But *clamping* to the cap is the wrong way to enforce it, because a clamp is silent and it
  /// hands back a **smaller budget than the caller asked for**. The lexer contract permits finite
  /// density above the cap, so the clamp had a reachable victim: on a one-unit source
  /// `budget_multiple(65_601)` should allow 65,665 items, the clamp allowed 65,600, and a legal

  /// [`run_partial`](Self::run_partial) while [`run`](Self::run) reported it as possibly
  /// nonterminating. Both are the same outcome — a conforming lexer rejected — reached from a
  /// setting the builder accepted without a word, which is the failure a test kit can least
  /// afford: the caller reads it as a verdict on their lexer.

  /// produces borrows its [`slice`](Lexer::slice) for `'inp`, so a buffer allocated per leg could
  /// not outlive the leg that made it. Both are the wall the whole tier rests on — the caller owns
  /// the buffer — so the driver is an argument rather than a mode.

  ///
  /// | driver | what a leg gets | what it can catch |
  /// |---|---|---|
  /// | [`OwnedChunks`] | a separately allocated copy of the prefix | the whole subject: state carried across a **change of buffer** |

  /// `SameAllocation` is the weaker one and it is not a default anybody inherits, for
  /// [`Budget`](crate::input::Budget)'s reason: a reduction in what a run certifies has to be
  /// *written* so that it surfaces in review. A lexer whose `State` carries anything derived from
  /// where the bytes are — a raw pointer, an interner keyed by address, a cached slice — passes
  /// under `SameAllocation` and fails on the first real refill, and a kit that chose that mode for
  /// you would be certifying less than this paragraph claims.
  ///
  /// The return value is the [`RefillCoverage`] the run actually reached: how many cut positions it
  /// drove schedules from, how many the sources offered, how many of those cuts got a buffer at
  /// an address the source does not share, and how many of the schedules it drove certified
  /// nothing because the document ended inside them. A driver that admits **no** cut below the
  /// source length certifies nothing about any change of buffer, and is refused rather than passed.
  ///
  /// What the kit checks about a supplied buffer is that it is a content-preserving prefix, and it
  /// checks that more than once — being asked for a buffer once stops a driver giving a second
  /// answer and does not stop it writing through a reference it already gave. What none of those
  /// checks establish is the gap *between* two of them, so a driver's buffers holding still for the
  /// duration of a run is stated as a requirement; [`RefillDriver`] carries it.

  /// What the kit cannot check at all is that a buffer *means* what the prefix means: the

  /// why it is stated rather than hooked or bounded. The two **shipped** drivers do not rest on
  /// that obligation, because their buffers are derived by the kit rather than supplied by the
  /// caller: they apply only to a [`SemanticPrefix`] source, which is the same promise sealed

  /// # The oracle, and the comparison it is drawn with
  ///
  /// The oracle is the **complete-input lex of the whole source** — the same reference
  /// [`run`](Self::run) captures, so the always-on trait-tier invariants are enforced here too and
  /// this entry point stands alone.
  ///
  /// Nothing about *what counts as equal* is decided here. The items are compared by
  /// `Item::compare` through `diverge`, which is the ranked search every other stream comparison
  /// in this module reads its answer from: a conclusive difference outranks an inconclusive one,
  /// a comparison a non-reflexive value decided is refused as `non-reflexive-payload` rather than
  /// reported as the lexer's fault, and a difference at the discriminant or in item count is
  /// conclusive by construction. A second implementation of that rule would be a second place for
  /// it to be wrong.
  ///
  /// # The driver this models, and where its rules come from
  ///
  /// A leg commits an item only when a [`Partial`] input would: an item whose **effective read
  /// frontier** (`max(span.end, `[`read_frontier`](crate::Lexer::read_frontier)`)`) reaches the
  /// non-final buffer end is withheld, because the decision consulted the end and later bytes
  /// could change it. Withholding is what keeps this from being stricter than the contract:
  /// without it, `"ab"` cut out of `"abc"` would commit a truncated token and resume behind the
  /// `c`, and **every** conforming lexer would red.
  ///
  /// When nothing is withheld and the lexer simply runs out of bytes, the leg carries the pair
  /// the layer reports at that point: the lexer's **post-exhaustion position** — clamped exactly
  /// as `InputRef::scan_with` clamps it, into `[last committed end, buffer len]` — and the state
  /// there. That is the case the whole tier is about. Bytes the lexer *skipped* before running
  /// out (trailing whitespace, a comment tail) are past the last item's end, so a driver that
  /// resumes at the reported offset resumes **inside** whatever the lexer was skipping — and a
  /// lexer that did not keep that fact in its state resumes in the wrong mode.
  ///
  /// The last buffer of a schedule is **final**, so the holdback is inert there and everything
  /// the lexer produces is committed — the same relaxation a sealed [`Partial`] input gets.
  ///
  /// A **terminal** item outranks all of that, exactly as it does in the layer. `InputRef::classify`
  /// asks the crate's terminal predicate — a failing [`Lexer::check`] — before
  /// the holdback is even consulted, and a driver that gets that answer emits, latches and **stops**.
  /// So a leg reaching one ends its schedule where it stands, and the schedule draws no comparison:

  /// refill, a tail delivered one unit at a time, a two-refill schedule from every cut, and a
  /// refill that **adds nothing**.
  ///
  /// Not covered, deliberately: a cut the source itself cannot be sliced at (`str[..k]` is not a

  /// answered `None` for, which is the caller's stated fact about their own chunks and is counted
  /// in [`RefillCoverage`] rather than assumed away; a buffer that *shrinks* or whose delivered
  /// bytes change (that is not a refill; a refill appends, and a driver that returns different
  /// bytes is refused); a driver that commits an item the frontier withheld (not a driver the

/// The refilling **driver** a [`run_refill`](Harness::run_refill) run models: where one of its

///
/// # Why those two questions are one method
///
/// The thing that produces chunks is the thing that knows where a chunk may end, and the buffer for
/// a cut a driver can never produce is a buffer it would never hold. [`buffer`](Self::buffer)
/// therefore answers both at once: `Some(buf)` is *this is what I hold once `k` units have
/// arrived*, `None` is *no chunk of mine ends at `k`*. Splitting them into a predicate and a
/// factory would create a state — a cut admitted with no buffer behind it — that the tier has no
/// action for, and a second place for the two answers to disagree.
///
/// # Why the kit cannot supply this itself
///
/// [`L::Source`](Lexer::Source) is `?Sized` (`str`, `[u8]`), so the kit cannot own one; and every
/// item a leg produces borrows its [`slice`](Lexer::slice) for `'inp`, so a buffer the kit
/// allocated for the duration of a leg could not outlive the leg that made it. Both are the wall
/// the whole tier rests on: tokora has no growable source, deliberately, and the caller owns the
/// buffer and grows it.
///
/// # What the kit checks about what you hand back
///
/// A returned buffer must be a **content-preserving prefix** — exactly `k` units long, equal unit
/// for unit to the first `k` units of `src`. A driver that returns different bytes turns every
/// verdict downstream of it into noise, so the kit refuses one, tagged `refill-buffer` and worded
/// as the kit's refusal rather than as the lexer's failure.
///
/// The kit asks **only** at positions [`Source::is_boundary`] already admits, and it asks about
/// each of them **once** per input. So a driver can narrow the cut set and can never widen it, and
/// an implementation that answered differently on a second call could not change what was driven.
///
/// Asking once is not the same as the answer holding still, so every buffer is checked twice: once
/// as it arrives, and once after the driver has answered every cut of that input and cannot be
/// called again. A driver that hands back a reference it can still write through — through a
/// `Cell`, a `RefCell`, an arena it reuses — would otherwise be able to rewrite a buffer that had
/// already passed while a later cut was being answered, and the schedules are built out of the
/// whole table at once. The second refusal says so in as many words.
///
/// The kit does not ask for the buffer at the source length: a schedule's last leg is the source
/// itself, sealed, because that is what makes the oracle comparison an equality over the value the
/// oracle lexed rather than over one that merely equals it.
///
/// # What it cannot check, and the obligation that covers it
///
/// That comparison is over [`Source::Slice`] values, and **slice equality is not source
/// equivalence**. A leg is handed the whole `S`, and a source is free to carry more than its slice
/// does: a mode flag, a keyword table, a dialect, an interner handle. Over such a source two values
/// can compare equal here and lex differently — a source of `{ text, keywords }` whose buffer holds
/// the right text under the wrong keyword set passes this check, and the lexer then commits an
/// identifier where the oracle has a keyword. The kit reports that as `refill-equivalence`, against
/// the lexer, which is exactly the mis-attribution the rest of this tier is built to avoid.
///
/// So the tier assumes a source **whose lexical semantics are fully represented by its
/// [`Slice`](Source::Slice)**, and where they are not, supplying a buffer that lexes like the
/// prefix it stands for is the driver's obligation. That is written here rather than checked, in
/// the same posture as [`run`](Harness::run)'s reflexivity obligation and the `Eq` that promises
/// reflexivity and does not keep it: the kit says what it has not checked instead of checking
/// something weaker and calling it the same thing.
///
/// **Why it is not a hook.** The check that would close it is a caller-supplied predicate saying
/// *this buffer means what that prefix means* — and a caller-supplied predicate is a
/// caller-supplied exemption. There is one such channel already,
/// [`over_cuts`](OwnedChunks::over_cuts), and it is a value in the caller's own source, seen in
/// review, precisely because no kit can tell a real rule from a convenient one. A second one here
/// would have the kit asking the driver to certify the driver, which is not evidence about
/// anything.
///
/// **Why it is not a bound.** A bound is what this kit reaches for first — [`run`](Harness::run)
/// buys item identity with `PartialEq` rather than with a caller's comparator — so the alternative
/// is worth writing down. The equality that would settle this is `buf` against *the first `k` units
/// of `src` as an `S`*, and the kit has no such value: constructing one needs
/// `S: Index<RangeTo<usize>, Output = S>`, which is the bound this tier dropped in order to exist,
/// since a source that cannot slice itself but can hand over a buffer is the caller a driver is
/// *for*. Re-adding it would deny the tier to that caller in order to check them. The other
/// spelling — a marker trait the caller implements to promise the property — is this obligation
/// with a compile step in front of it: unverifiable in the same way, and additionally denying the
/// tier to every source that has not written the impl. Neither buys a check; both buy an exclusion.
///
/// [`SemanticPrefix`] is neither of those, and the difference is what makes it possible: it bounds
/// the two **shipped** drivers rather than this trait, so no source loses the tier; and it is
/// **sealed**, so it is not a promise a caller makes about themselves. It is the crate naming the
/// sources whose buffers the kit is entitled to derive on its own.
///
/// What is left is a boundary a reader can see, and it binds a **hand-written** driver over a
/// source with slice-invisible state: hand back the buffer your own chunking would hold, not one
/// that merely slices the same.
///
/// The shipped drivers do not stand on that obligation, because it is not theirs to keep. They
/// derive their buffers by indexing the source, which is caller code, and `Index<RangeTo<usize>,
/// Output = S>` proves nothing about meaning — a source of `{ text, keywords }` may legally index
/// to stored prefixes under the wrong flag, and then a driver the kit ships produces a
/// lexer-blaming red over identical validated slices. So [`SameAllocation`] and [`OwnedChunks`]
/// require [`SemanticPrefix`], which is where that promise is written down and why it is sealed.
///
/// # The buffers do not change while the run does
///
/// The kit validates a buffer as it arrives, again once the driver has answered every cut, again
/// before any divergence is blamed on the lexer, and again once every schedule of that input has
/// run. What none of that establishes is the *gap between* two of those checks: the schedules lex
/// through the driver's own `Source` impl, through the slice type's equality and destructor, and
/// through whatever handle the driver kept, and a buffer that is rewritten and put back between
/// two checks is a buffer the kit has no way to see.
///
/// So it is a requirement rather than a check, in the same posture as the obligation above: **the
/// bytes behind a buffer you hand back do not change for the duration of the run.** A driver that
/// owns its buffers outright — [`OwnedChunks`] — keeps it by construction. One that hands out

/// It costs a slice-invisible source nothing but the shortcut. The tier stays open to it —

///
/// > **Every [`Lexer::lex`] attempt the kit causes through the input layer, anywhere beneath one

/// > restore returns capacity to it. Every narrower budget — items per drain, attempts per lexer
/// > instance — exists for a sharper message and is not the bound.**
///
/// # A budget bounds only the loops that increment it
///
/// That sentence is the whole rule, and this counter is where four rounds of getting it wrong
/// ended up. The kit lexes in two shapes:
///
/// - **directly**, in [`lex_run`], [`check_sticky`], [`check_span_after_exhaustion`],
///   [`check_resume`] and [`CacheHarness::corpus`](cache::CacheHarness) — there the counter and the
///   `lex()` call are in the *same loop body*, so the counter is the loop's own trip count and
///   bounds it by construction. Those need nothing from here.
/// - **through the input layer**, where the nesting is `Harness` → prefix or schedule → drain loop
///   → [`InputRef::next`](crate::InputRef::next) / [`peek`](crate::InputRef::peek) → the scanner's
///   `while let Some(item)` loop → `lex()`. The kit owns the outermost loops and the innermost
///   call and **none of the ones in between**. Every guard placed on one of those boundaries was
///   escaped by a loop underneath it:
///
///   | guard at | escaped by |
///   |---|---|
///   | one clear per `lex` | `logos` resolving `Skip` with several scans inside one `lex` |
///   | items per `next()` | the scanner looping over the lexer errors it accepts, which the span-end dedup keeps out of the log |
///   | attempts per lexer instance | the layer building a **fresh lexer for every `next()`**, so the counter restarts on every call |
///
///   The third is the trap this type exists to close: a per-instance counter *looks* like it is
///   "inside `next()`", and it is — but a fresh instance per call makes it a per-call counter, and
///   a lexer that spends `limit - 1` attempts before each token walks a `run_partial` corpus in
///   Θ(n³) raw lex work with the item budget flat (the dedup hides the repeats) and the instance
///   budget reset (a new lexer holds it).
///
/// # Why this boundary is the last one
///
/// Two reasons, and the second is the one that matters.
///
/// **There is no loop left above it that lexer behaviour can drive.** The tally is created once per
/// input by the tier entry ([`check_partial`], [`check_integration`]); the only loop above that is
/// `for (idx, src) in self.inputs`, whose trip count is the caller's own input list — data, not
/// behaviour. Everything below it — prefixes, schedules, drains, `next`/`peek` calls, lexer
/// instances, scanner iterations — charges the same counter.
///
/// **And there is nothing left below it to subdivide.** Each guard before this one counted a
/// *proxy* for lexer work — probe clears, items a drain yielded, attempts by one instance — and
/// every proxy had a finer loop underneath it to hide in, which is why the same defect kept
/// reappearing one boundary further out. This counts [`Lexer::lex`] itself, which is the primitive
/// the kit is trying to bound: there is no finer operation for a loop to sit between it and the
/// counter, because the counter *is* at the operation. Raw lexing is also the only unbounded
/// resource down there — a token served from the cache costs no lex, and every other observable the
/// layer reads (`span`, `slice`, `read_frontier`, `bump`) is called a bounded number of times per
/// attempt or per item.
///
/// What that leaves open is only *where the handle is created*, and that is a parameter rather than
/// a mechanism. If a loop is ever added above a tier entry — a repeat knob, a second corpus pass —
/// the repair is to construct the tally one level further out and pass the same handle down. The
/// four relocations before this one each needed a new mechanism; this one would need an argument
/// moved.
///
/// # What it still cannot bound, and why nothing could
///
/// A [`Lexer::lex`] call that never returns. Every lever the kit has is *between* calls, so a lexer
/// that loops inside one is beyond this counter and beyond any counter a kit could hold. What this
/// bounds is the case that looks identical from outside and is not: a lexer that returns promptly,
/// every time, forever.
///
/// # Why it cannot be refunded
///
/// The count lives in a `Cell` behind an [`Rc`] and the handle rides in the lexer's `State`
/// ([`Tallied`]), which is the one channel [`Lexer::with_state`] has. Everything the input layer
/// does to a state — clone it into a [`CachedToken`](crate::cache::CachedToken), stash it in a
/// checkpoint, restore an older one, hand it to a rebuilt lexer — copies the **handle**, and every
/// handle addresses the one cell. So a rollback rewinds the lexer and cannot rewind the tally:
/// what it restores is a pointer, not the count.
///
/// That is the difference from a tally kept *as a field* of the thing being rolled back, which is
/// refunded by the rollback and is therefore not a budget at all.
///
/// # Monotone by construction, not by convention
///
/// The count is a private field of a type in a **private submodule**, so "nothing writes it but
/// [`spend`](LexTally::spend)" is enforced by the compiler rather than asserted in this comment:
/// outside `tally`, the only reachable operations are constructing one, charging one attempt, and
/// reading the total. There is no reset and no setter to reach.
///
/// Nor is there a constructor reachable from a lexer: [`Lexer::new`] is handed only a source, so
/// [`Budgeted::new`] cannot obtain a tally — it builds an already-spent one, so a drive the kit did
/// not seed refuses on its first attempt instead of running unbounded.

///
/// A lexer that never returns from a single [`InputRef::next`](crate::InputRef::next) — the
/// scanner accepting the same error forever inside one call. The tally catches that too, but only
/// after the whole tier's allowance: `O(units²)` attempts in the partial tier, against `O(units)`
/// here. And the message differs in kind, not only in latency — "one lexer instance was asked to
/// lex more than N times without yielding a token or exhausting" names a scan that will not
/// return, where the aggregate can only report that the tier as a whole did too much work.
///
/// ## Why the number may only come from the tally
///
/// It used to be `DEFAULT_BUDGET_MULTIPLE * units + BUDGET_FLOOR`, computed in
/// [`wrap`](Self::wrap) from the source *this instance* was handed, and that was wrong twice over:
/// it ignored [`Harness::budget_multiple`], so a lexer certified under a raised budget was refused
/// at the default anyway; and in the partial tier the source is a *prefix*, so the ceiling shrank
/// with the cut while the run it was bounding did not. Both directions produced the same failure —
/// a **conforming lexer rejected** — which is the one failure a narrower guard may never cause,
/// because the sharper message it exists to give is worth nothing if it is a lie.
///
/// So the number is derived once, from the configured budget, and carried on the tally: every
/// instance under one tier gets the same ceiling, and it is one this run's own item budget already
/// says a conforming lexer stays under. A scan produces at most the items left in the run, and the
/// run may produce at most `budget` of them, so `budget + 1` attempts inside one scan cannot be
/// reached by a lexer the item budget accepts.
///
/// # Why the state is mirrored, and why the mirror is read-only until someone writes it
///
/// `Self::State` has to be [`Tallied<L::State>`](Tallied) — that is the channel — and
/// [`Lexer::state`] must hand out a `&Tallied<L::State>`, which cannot be synthesised from the

/// the mirror is refreshed from it after every call that can change it (`lex`, `bump`).
///
/// The reverse direction — writing the mirror back into the inner lexer — happens **only if
/// someone actually mutated through [`Lexer::state_mut`]**, tracked by `written`. That condition is

/// multiple and at **11,580** units at the default one. The tally then stopped being a bound
/// derived from the source and became a flat cap of `usize::MAX` attempts, flat while the formula
/// it replaced kept growing: about **75× short** at 100,000 units, against the 320,035,600,844 the
/// derivation asks for.
///
/// **That cap was reachable by an ordinary lexer over an ordinary source**, which is what made it
/// a defect rather than a recorded cost. A conforming [`SpanEnd`](ReadFrontier::SpanEnd) lexer
/// emitting one item per byte spends about one attempt per item, and the partial sweep drives it
/// over every split of the source: over 100 KB that is on the order of five billion prefix
/// attempts — already past `usize::MAX` at 32 bits before the two full-input drains are counted.
/// Such a lexer passed at 64 bits and took an ordinary `lex-budget` refusal at 32, and no
/// [`budget_multiple`](Harness::budget_multiple) setting helped, because every permitted one
/// collapses to the same cap.
///
/// So the ceiling and the count are `u128`, which is width-independent: the number this returns is
/// the same on every target, and the 32-bit refusal is gone rather than merely raised. What that
/// costs is 16-byte arithmetic on a comparison made once per [`Lexer::lex`] attempt in a
/// conformance kit — a test harness that already clones a lexer state per attempt.
///
/// # The residue, and why it is reported as the kit's limit
///
/// `u128` is still finite, so the product is computed with **checked** arithmetic and
/// [`AttemptCeiling::Capacity`] records the one case it does not fit. That is exact rather than a

/// genuinely overflowed, so the flag never mislabels a ceiling that happens to be large.
///
/// Reaching it needs roughly 2⁵⁵ source units — about 36 petabytes in one slice — so nothing that

/// the span, the source slice, the span offsets and the read frontier. Reflexivity is the one law
/// of an equivalence relation that `PartialEq` does not promise, and when a payload breaks it the
/// comparison fails for a reason that is a **fact about the value type** and not about the lexer,
/// the cache or the input layer under test.
///
/// The components bounded to a *total* equality reach this line too, and that is the round-5
/// residue rather than an oversight. `Eq` and `Ord` do promise reflexivity — but they are markers,
/// nothing verifies the promise, and a caller who breaks one has broken a **stronger** contract,
/// not put themselves outside this kit's reach. Refusing there says the same true thing: the
/// comparison that failed was the caller's and the kit convicted nobody. The tag stays
/// `non-reflexive-payload` for every component, because the tag names the *diagnosis* #295
/// established and every cell and downstream grep keys on it; the component the refusal names is
/// what says whether a total or a partial promise was the one broken.
///
/// The failure that produced is not merely mislabelled, it is unreadable: a final partial drain
/// compares a stream against itself, so `expected` and `got` are the same item, and the
/// `partial-equivalence` panic hands the consumer a red accusing their lexer with two values that
/// **render identically** (`NaN` and `NaN`). That was #295, and 38 corpus queries in one
/// downstream reached it.
///
/// So before a tier reports divergence it asks whether the **operation that decided it** is equal
/// to itself, and a side whose is not gets this refusal instead — a distinct tag, the component
/// that will not compare, and the obligation it comes from. The kit says what it cannot check
/// rather than naming a culprit it has not identified.
///
/// # It asks about the comparison that ran, and about nothing else
///
/// `component` comes from [`Decided`], which every [`Comparison`] in the kit produces from the
/// two values whose comparison failed. It is never a scan of the item, and the difference is the
/// whole of what a scan got wrong: a scan runs afterwards and knows nothing about *why*, so a
/// divergence settled at the **discriminant** — a committed token on one side, a lexer error on
/// the other, no caller equality consulted at all — still turned up a `NaN` somewhere in the
/// payload and was refused. That is a diagnosis stated without having been established, and the
/// thing it hid is the truncation nonconformance the partial tier is built to report. A
/// difference at the discriminant, or at a component whose comparison is sound, is therefore
/// terminal here: this returns without a word and the ordinary verdict follows.
///
/// # It can only ever re-label a failure, never create one
///
/// Every call site reaches this **after** its own comparison has already failed, so a run that
/// passes cannot be turned red by it and a run this refuses was already going to be reported as a
/// failure. That is what keeps the repair from trading a false red for a false green: a
/// genuinely non-conforming lexer whose payloads *are* reflexive never reaches this line and
/// still fails the ordinary way, with the ordinary tag.
///
/// Since round 5 it is reached later still: only once [`Ranking`] has run every remaining step of
/// the same search — the rest of the item, the rest of the stream, the item count, the other arm
/// — and found nothing the kit could convict on. A refusal is now the answer of last resort in
/// the strict sense, and that is the second half of the same rule.
///
/// # This is not a relaxation of the contract
///
/// The obligation predates the report: [`Harness::run_partial`]'s documentation has said since

///
/// # The shapes are derived, and this is the list
///
/// A cut is any position the source can be sliced at **and** the driver can end a chunk at — so the
/// named shapes (inside a token, at a token boundary, inside trivia, at end of input, at offset
/// zero) are covered by construction rather than by being listed, for a driver that narrows
/// nothing. What is enumerated here is the *schedule* around a cut, because a schedule is not
/// derivable from a position:
///
/// | schedule | what only it reaches |
/// |---|---|
/// | `[k, len]` | one refill delivering the whole tail — the shape a driver takes on the last chunk |
/// | `[k, k, len]` | a refill that **adds nothing**: a driver handed a zero-byte chunk re-drives a buffer that grew by nothing, so the carried pair has to survive being spent on it |
/// | `[k, k', len]` | a minimal refill of one admitted cut and then the rest: two carries from one cut, the first landing at the driver's next legal chunk end |
/// | every admitted cut | the tail one chunk at a time, from the first admitted buffer to the whole source — the state crossing as many buffers as the driver has legal chunk ends |
///
/// Every schedule ends at the source length and that leg is **final**, so each one that runs to
/// the end reaches the same equality against the complete-input parse. A schedule whose leg goes
/// [`LegEnd::Terminal`] does not run to the end and draws no comparison — see below.
///
/// The cost is one leg per cut per schedule shape, and a leg lexes at most the source: Θ(n²) raw
/// lexing per input, the order [`check_partial`] and [`check_resume`] already cost.
///
/// # A terminal stop is counted, and an input made only of them is refused
///
/// The promise this tier makes about a terminal leg is **non-certifying**, not *compared
/// differently*, and the two are different promises. Comparing differently would need a second
/// oracle — the complete input lexed under the same terminal-first ranking — and the two runs stop
/// at legitimately different items: the tally a limit trips on is per lexer, and a refilling driver
/// builds a fresh lexer for every leg, which is the very reason the layer latches the boundary at
/// the *input* level. Comparing two streams that stop in different places would report a count
/// divergence against the lexer for something that is not a refill defect at all, and truncating
/// both to the shorter would leave a comparison whose length the lexer chooses — vacuous exactly
/// where the trip is early. So the schedule certifies nothing, and the run says so out loud.
///
/// Saying so is two things. Every schedule is counted, and every terminal one too, so
/// [`RefillCoverage`] carries the ratio for a caller to read the way it reads a narrowed cut set.
/// And an input **all** of whose schedules ended terminally certified nothing whatever about a
/// change of buffer, which is [`resolve_buffers`]'s refusal in a different coat: it is refused

///
/// # Why a buffer is validated more than once, and what that still does not buy

/// **Asking once prevents a second answer; it does not freeze the first one.** A buffer checked the
/// instant it arrives is checked while the driver still has `k+1..len` callbacks to run, and every
/// one of those is an opportunity to write through whatever the returned reference points at — a

/// rewritten while cut 3 was being answered is lexed in its rewritten form, and the divergence that
/// follows is reported against the lexer.
///
/// So the table is checked again once the driver will not be called again. That closes the window
/// the driver's own **callbacks** open, and it closes nothing else — which is the correction to
/// what this paragraph used to claim. It said the second pass was the first moment at which "these
/// bytes are a prefix of the source" was a statement about all of them at the same time, and it is
/// not: the pass itself runs caller code at every step (`Source::as_slice`, `Source::slice`, the
/// slice's `PartialEq`, and the destructor of the `got` value it drops *after* a successful
/// comparison), and the schedules then lex those same references through more of it. A driver that
/// retained a handle — a `Cell`, a shared or atomic cell, an arena — can still write through it at
/// any of those points.
///
/// What the kit does about the part it cannot close is validate at the two moments where a stale
/// buffer would otherwise cost something:
///
/// - **before anything is blamed on the lexer** — both the divergence [`assert_refill_eq`] reports
///   and the non-termination refusal [`refill_leg`] raises against its budget — so a buffer that
///   changed wins the diagnosis and the refusal is the driver's, which is the verdict the fact
///   supports; and
/// - **after the last schedule has run** ([`check_refill`]), so a rewrite that produced no
///   divergence cannot leave a green earned over bytes the oracle never lexed.
///
/// Both are the same one comparison, and each pass costs one slice comparison per exercised cut —
/// Θ(n²) bytes over an input of n units, the order this tier already lexes at, and the first of the
/// two runs only on a path that is about to panic anyway.
///
/// The residue is a buffer that is rewritten and put back before the next check sees it, and no
/// amount of re-checking closes that one. It is stated as a requirement on the driver instead —

///   committed** item — the incoming pair, when it committed none. Rolling back to it is what
///   makes the tier sound rather than strict: the withheld item's bytes are re-lexed on the
///   grown buffer, which is what the driver would do.
/// - **Exhaustion.** Nothing was withheld and the lexer ran out of bytes, so the pair is the
///   lexer's own post-exhaustion position and the state there. **This is the case the tier
///   exists for**: the position covers bytes the lexer *skipped* without emitting an item, so a
///   driver resuming there resumes inside whatever the lexer was in the middle of.
///
/// The position is clamped into `[last committed end, buffer len]`, which is the identical
/// defence in depth `InputRef::scan_with` applies to the offset it reports — a floor against a
/// retracting span and a ceiling against one that over-reports. It is not the specification: the
/// post-exhaustion span is specified by the trait and checked by `check_span_after_exhaustion`,
/// which reports a violation of it precisely. The clamp only keeps *that* defect from arriving
/// here dressed as a refill divergence.
///
/// A third answer, [`LegEnd::Terminal`], is not a pair at all: it is the leg reporting that the
/// document ended inside it, and the pair it returns beside it is never resumed from.
