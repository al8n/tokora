# Source, Slice, and storage backends

Every parser in this book has been generic over a lifetime `'inp` and a lexer `L`, and has run
over `&str` without ever saying why it *could* run over anything else. This chapter is the why.

Tokora's engine — the on-demand, parse-while-lexing machinery introduced in
[chapter 2](super::ch02_parsers), and the immutable-slice model of
[chapter 9](super::ch09_streaming) — never touches a `str` or a `[u8]` directly. It reads the
input through two small traits, [`Source`](crate::Source) and [`Slice`](crate::Slice). Everything
else — owned or borrowed, text or raw bytes, `std` or bare-metal — is a matter of which type you
hand it.

Like [the previous chapter](super::arch_parsing_engine), this one keeps Part III's register: less
*here is how to use it*, more *here is why it is shaped this way*.

## The problem: one engine, two axes of representation

A parser combinator library that hard-codes `&str` cannot lex a binary format; one that
hard-codes `&[u8]` throws away UTF-8's guarantees and has to re-check code-point boundaries by
hand. And neither can accept an *owned, reference-counted* buffer of the kind an async I/O stack
hands you — the `bytes::Bytes` your socket already filled — without a copy back down to a borrow.

The input a real program has on hand varies along two independent axes:

- **owned vs borrowed** — a `&str` you are lending the parser, versus a `bytes::Bytes` or a
  `HipStr` the parser can hold a cheap clone of;
- **text-shaped vs byte-shaped** — a source whose atom is a Unicode scalar value (`char`, with
  code-point boundaries to respect) versus one whose atom is a raw `u8` (any index is a valid cut).

Tokora refuses to pick for you. Instead it names the *seam* — the handful of operations the engine
actually needs from an input — as a trait, implements that trait once for `str` and once for
`[u8]`, and lets feature-gated backends add more. A parser written against the seam is
representation-agnostic for free; it never mentions a concrete source type at all.

## The seam is two traits

The engine needs to ask two different questions, so there are two traits:

- [`Source`](crate::Source) is implemented on the **input medium** — the whole thing being lexed
  (`str`, `[u8]`, `bytes::Bytes`, …). It answers *how long are you, and give me the sub-range
  `a..b`*.
- [`Slice`](crate::Slice) is implemented on **what a span of that medium looks like** — the value
  a lexer yields for one token (`&str`, `&[u8]`, a cheap `Bytes` clone, …). It answers *what are
  your characters, and how many*.

They are bound together by one associated type: `Source::Slice<'a>: Slice<'a>`. Slicing a
`Source` produces something that is itself a `Slice`. That is the whole contract, and it is why
[`SliceOf<'inp, L>`](crate::SliceOf) — the projection `<L::Source as Source>::Slice<'inp>` — is
the type generic parser code reaches for whenever it wants the raw text of a token.

### `Source`: addressing the medium

```rust,ignore
pub trait Source<Cursor>: core::fmt::Debug {
    type Slice<'source>: Slice<'source> where Self: 'source;

    fn is_empty(&self) -> bool;
    fn len(&self) -> Cursor;
    fn slice<R>(&self, range: R) -> Option<Self::Slice<'_>>
    where R: RangeBounds<Cursor>;

    fn find_boundary(&self, index: Cursor) -> Cursor { index } // default
    fn is_boundary(&self, index: Cursor) -> bool;
}
```

Three things are worth reading closely.

- **`Cursor` is a type parameter, not `usize`.** A `Source` is addressed by whatever offset type
  its lexer uses; the core impls fix it to `usize`, but the trait does not. This is the same
  `Offset` a [`Lexer`](crate::Lexer) declares (`Lexer::Source: Source<Lexer::Offset>`), so the
  offset arithmetic the engine does and the addressing the source understands are the same type by
  construction.
- **`slice` is fallible and zero-copy.** It returns `Option<Self::Slice<'_>>` — `None` for an
  out-of-range or (for text) boundary-splitting range, mirroring `slice::get`. The `'_` ties the
  returned slice to the borrow of `self`, which is exactly what lets a token's payload be a view
  into the source rather than a fresh allocation.
- **`find_boundary` and `is_boundary` are the entire text/byte distinction.** This is the design
  decision that keeps the rest of the engine shape-blind.

### The boundary discipline

`is_boundary(i)` asks *is `i` a legal place to cut?* `find_boundary(i)` asks *what is the nearest
legal cut at or below `i`?* The two core impls answer differently, and that difference is the only
place in tokora where "text" and "bytes" mean different things:

| | `str` (text) | `[u8]` (bytes) |
|---|---|---|
| `is_boundary(i)` | `self.is_char_boundary(i)` | `i <= self.len()` |
| `find_boundary(i)` | round **down** to a code-point boundary | `i` unchanged (the default) |

For bytes every in-range index is a boundary, so `find_boundary` is the identity and costs
nothing. For text, `find_boundary` walks *down* from `i` until it lands on a code-point boundary
(indices at or past the end are returned unchanged, matching the byte behavior). A lexer that
advances by a byte count it computed from a regex can therefore call `find_boundary` and be
guaranteed a slice position that will not split a multi-byte scalar — the same call is a no-op on
a byte source and a safety net on a text source. This is why [`Lexer::bump`](crate::Lexer) can
promise it never lands "in the middle of a UTF-8 code point (does not apply when lexing raw
`&[u8]`)": the promise is delegated to the `Source` impl, made once, and inherited by every
backend of the same shape.

### `Slice`: reading a span

```rust,ignore
pub trait Slice<'source>: PartialEq + Eq + core::fmt::Debug {
    type Char: Copy + core::fmt::Debug + PartialEq + Eq + core::hash::Hash;
    type Iter<'a>: Iterator<Item = Self::Char> where Self: 'a;
    type PositionedIter<'a>: Iterator<Item = (usize, Self::Char)> where Self: 'a;

    fn iter<'a>(&'a self) -> Self::Iter<'a> where Self: 'a;
    fn positioned_iter<'a>(&'a self) -> Self::PositionedIter<'a> where Self: 'a;
    fn len(&self) -> usize;
    fn is_empty(&self) -> bool { self.len() == 0 } // default
}
```

`Slice::Char` is the shape marker in the type system: `char` for a text slice, `u8` for a byte
slice, and it must match the character type the underlying lexer works in. The two iterators are
the whole reading interface — `iter` for the characters, `positioned_iter` for
`(offset, character)` pairs — and the core impls simply forward to the standard-library iterators
that already do the right thing: `str::Chars` / `str::CharIndices` for `&str`, and
`Copied<slice::Iter>` / `Enumerate<…>` for `&[u8]`. There is no bespoke UTF-8 decoding in tokora;
`Slice` is a thin, uniform face over machinery `core` already ships.

(Do not confuse [`Slice`](crate::Slice) with the [`Sliced<D, Src>`](crate::slice::Sliced) struct
that lives in the same module. `Slice` is the *span of a source*; `Sliced` is an unrelated
provenance wrapper — a value paired with *which* source it came from, e.g. a file name — the
counterpart to [`Spanned`](crate::span::Spanned)'s *where within* a source.)

## The backends

Beyond the two always-present core impls, four optional crates each add `Source`/`Slice` impls for
their buffer types. Every one reuses the same iterator machinery as the core — the byte-shaped
backends borrow `<[u8]>::iter().copied()`, the text-shaped ones borrow `str::Chars` — so a backend
is really just *an owner type plus its slicing and its boundary rule*. Byte-shaped backends
delegate `is_boundary` straight to the `[u8]` rule (`i <= len`); the text-shaped ones
(`HipStr`, `Utf8Bytes`) replicate the `str` char-boundary logic verbatim.

| Backend | Feature | Type(s) | Owned / borrowed | Shape (`Char`) | `Slice<'a>` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| core text | *(always on)* | `str` | borrowed | text — `char` | `&str` |
| core bytes | *(always on)* | `[u8]` | borrowed | bytes — `u8` | `&[u8]` |
| [`bytes`](https://docs.rs/bytes) | `bytes_1` | `Bytes` | owned (ref-counted) | bytes — `u8` | `Bytes` |
| [`bstr`](https://docs.rs/bstr) | `bstr_1` | `BStr` | borrowed | bytes — `u8` | `&[u8]` |
| [`hipstr`](https://docs.rs/hipstr) | `hipstr_0_8` | `HipStr<'_>` | owned *or* borrowed | text — `char` | `HipStr<'_>` |
| [`hipstr`](https://docs.rs/hipstr) | `hipstr_0_8` | `HipByt<'_>` | owned *or* borrowed | bytes — `u8` | `HipByt<'_>` |
| [`smol-bytes`](https://docs.rs/smol-bytes) | `smol_bytes_0_1` | `shared::Bytes` | owned (ref-counted, ≤62 B inline) | bytes — `u8` | `shared::Bytes` |
| [`smol-bytes`](https://docs.rs/smol-bytes) | `smol_bytes_0_1` | `compact::Bytes` | owned (≤62 B inline) | bytes — `u8` | `compact::Bytes` |
| [`smol-bytes`](https://docs.rs/smol-bytes) | `smol_bytes_0_1` | `Utf8Bytes` | owned (ref-counted, ≤62 B inline) | text — `char` | `Utf8Bytes` |

The single most important column is **`Slice<'a>`**. For the borrowed backends it is a plain
reference, as you would expect. But for the *owned* backends it is the owner type again, not a
`&`-borrow — `bytes::Bytes::Slice = Bytes`, `HipStr::Slice = HipStr`, and so on. That is not a
copy: these types slice in O(1) by bumping a reference count (`bytes`, `smol-bytes` `shared`) or,
for a small enough span, by inlining ≤62 bytes into the handle (`smol-bytes`). An owned source is
therefore *still* zero-copy to slice — tokora does not force borrowing to get the property; it
lets each representation express its own cheapest slice, and refcounted buffers happen to have a
very cheap one.

A quick tour of what each backend is *for*:

- **`bytes_1`** exposes [`bytes::Bytes`](https://docs.rs/bytes) — the de-facto owned, cheaply
  cloneable byte buffer of the async ecosystem. Reach for it when the bytes you want to parse
  already arrived as a `Bytes` and you want to keep token slices alive past the parse without
  copying.
- **`bstr_1`** exposes [`bstr::BStr`](https://docs.rs/bstr), a borrowed, byte-shaped view whose
  slices are `&[u8]`. It is the "bytes that are *conventionally* text but not guaranteed UTF-8"
  case; the impl is a thin forward to the `[u8]` behavior.
- **`hipstr_0_8`** exposes the [`hipstr`](https://docs.rs/hipstr) inline-or-shared-or-borrowed
  hybrids in *both* shapes: `HipStr` (text) and `HipByt` (bytes). A `HipStr` may be a small string
  stored inline, a reference-counted heap share, or a borrow — and slicing it preserves whichever
  it is, so it is the flexible choice when you do not know in advance whether inputs are tiny or
  huge.
- **`smol_bytes_0_1`** exposes three impls from [`smol-bytes`](https://docs.rs/smol-bytes): the
  byte-shaped `shared::Bytes` (the default; ref-counted heap with a 62-byte inline
  small-buffer optimization, and zero-copy convertible with `bytes::Bytes`), the byte-shaped
  `compact::Bytes` (same inline threshold, but it re-inlines a shrinking view to *release* its
  allocation), and the text-shaped `Utf8Bytes` (a UTF-8 wrapper over the shared strategy — the
  `char`-shaped counterpart to `HipStr`). All three are owned and all three slice cheaply.

### Why the feature names carry versions

The feature that turns a backend on is `bytes_1`, not `bytes`; `hipstr_0_8`, not `hipstr`. Each
versioned feature enables a `package`-renamed optional dependency pinned to one SemVer-major line
of the upstream crate (`bytes_1 = { package = "bytes", version = "1", … }`), and a bare alias
forwards to the current one (`bytes = ["bytes_1"]`). This is the same discipline the crate uses
for the logos adapter (`logos_0_14` / `logos_0_15` / `logos_0_16`): it lets tokora support several
incompatible majors of a backend *at once*, and add support for a new major as a purely additive
feature — no breaking change to anyone pinned to the old one.

## `no_std` posture

The category list in `Cargo.toml` includes `no-std::no-alloc`, and that is a load-bearing claim,
not an aspiration. The two core impls — `Source`/`Slice` for `str` and `[u8]` — carry **no**
feature gate at all. They are `core`-only: no `std`, no `alloc`, no allocator. A parser whose
lexer sources from `&str` or `&[u8]` compiles and runs on bare metal, and that is the baseline the
whole abstraction rests on.

The feature graph layers up from there:

- **no feature** → `core` only. Core `str` / `[u8]` sources, the parser itself, and its
  stack-buffered lookahead window (1-32 tokens) — no allocator in sight.
- **`alloc`** → adds the allocator-backed pieces (growable containers, the session stack) while
  staying `no_std`.
- **`std`** (default) → everything, plus it turns on the upstream backends' own default features.

The backend features themselves are deliberately *not* uniform about `std`:

- `bytes_1`, `bstr_1`, and `hipstr_0_8` bring their crates in with `default-features = false`, so
  enabling a backend does **not** drag in `std`. `bstr_1` and `bytes_1` even compile with neither
  `std` nor `alloc` turned on in tokora (their owned buffers still need a global allocator to
  *link* into a final binary, but tokora's feature graph leaves that choice to you rather than
  forcing it).
- `smol_bytes_0_1` is the one exception: it implies `std`. This is a documented decision in
  `Cargo.toml` — smol-bytes is a `cdylib`+`rlib` crate that needs a global allocator and panic
  handler even to *check*, so tokora gates it on `std`, mirroring how the `rowan` feature is
  handled.

However far down you turn the graph, the parser you write does not change. It is generic over
`L: Lexer`, and `L::Source` is *some* `Source`; the concrete choice of representation lives at the
call site, not in the grammar.

### The entry-point family

The [`Parse`](crate::Parse) trait's methods are the ergonomic front door to all of this.
[`parse`](crate::Parse::parse) / [`parse_with_state`](crate::Parse::parse_with_state) are the
general form — they take `&L::Source` for whatever source your lexer declared, so a lexer whose
`Source` is `bytes::Bytes` or `smol_bytes::compact::Bytes` is driven through exactly these. On top
of them sit conveniences: [`parse_str`](crate::Parse::parse_str) and
[`parse_slice`](crate::Parse::parse_slice) for the core `str` / `[u8]` shapes, and — behind their
respective backend features — `parse_bytes`, `parse_bstr`, and `parse_hipstr`.

There is a subtlety worth naming, because it explains why those last three exist. `parse_bytes`,
`parse_bstr`, and `parse_hipstr` are *convenience over a core-sourced lexer*: each requires
`L::Source` to be `[u8]` (or `str`) and simply borrows your owned buffer down to `&[u8]` / `&str`
before parsing. They are for "I am holding a `bytes::Bytes` but my lexer reads `[u8]`." The
owned-type `Source` impls in the table above are the *other* path — they are what a lexer uses
when its `Source` associated type genuinely *is* the owned type, and it is that path that gives
you owned, refcount-sliced tokens.

## The abstraction, exercised

Nothing above needs a lexer to demonstrate — the `Source` and `Slice` traits stand on their own.
Here is one function generic over `Source` and one generic over `Slice`, each run over both a
text source and a byte source, with the boundary discipline doing its job:

```rust
use tokora::{Slice, Source};

// Representation-agnostic: take the leading `n` cursor units of any source,
// snapping `n` to a valid boundary so the returned slice is always well-formed.
// For `str` that means a UTF-8 code-point boundary; for `[u8]` every index is a
// boundary, so nothing moves.
fn head<S>(src: &S, n: usize) -> Option<S::Slice<'_>>
where
    S: Source<usize> + ?Sized,
{
    let end = src.find_boundary(n.min(src.len()));
    src.slice(..end)
}

// Slice-level: how many *elements* does this span iterate? The element type is
// the slice's `Char` — `char` for text, `u8` for bytes.
fn elements<'s, S: Slice<'s>>(span: &S) -> usize {
    span.iter().count()
}

// "héllo": 'é' is a two-byte code point, so the text is 6 bytes long.
let text: &str = "héllo";
assert_eq!(text.len(), 6);

// Asking for 2 bytes lands *inside* 'é'. The str source snaps down to a
// boundary, so `head` yields "h" — never a panic, never a split scalar.
assert_eq!(head(text, 2), Some("h"));

// The exact same code over bytes keeps both bytes: every index is valid there.
let bytes: &[u8] = b"h\xC3\xA9llo"; // the UTF-8 encoding of "héllo"
assert_eq!(head(bytes, 2), Some(b"h\xC3".as_slice()));

// One text, two shapes: `str` iterates 5 scalar values; `[u8]` iterates 6 bytes.
assert_eq!(elements(&text), 5);
assert_eq!(elements(&text.as_bytes()), 6);
```

Note the asymmetry the two signatures reveal: `head` is generic over `S = str` / `[u8]` — the
*medium*, which is what implements `Source` — while `elements` is generic over `S = &str` /
`&[u8]` — the *span*, which is what implements `Slice`. `Source::Slice<'a>: Slice<'a>` is the hinge
that connects them, and it is the only line of glue the engine needs to be blind to representation.

The same `head` would compile unchanged for a lexer sourced from `bytes::Bytes` or `HipStr`; the
only thing that changes is the concrete `S::Slice<'_>` it returns — a refcount bump instead of a
borrow. That is the payoff of naming the seam: the grammar is written once, and the choice of how
the input is stored is somebody else's, made later, at the edge.
