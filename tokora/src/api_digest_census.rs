//! API_DIGEST_CENSUS — every guide fence that re-declares a public item, read against the item.
//!
//! The guide quotes tokora's public surface in *digests*: a fenced block that re-types a trait's
//! members so a chapter can talk about the shape without sending the reader to rustdoc. A digest
//! is prose, and prose is uncompiled. `270cf01` ruled out `ignore` (outside every gate), a
//! compiled doctest gates a *shadow copy* and says nothing about the real item, and `text` is
//! honest and silent. Every one of the four drifts fixed in `6351204` lived in exactly that gap:
//!
//! * `Lexer::read_frontier` written `-> ReadFrontier<usize>` where the trait says `Self::Offset`,
//!   in two chapters;
//! * the same line written **with a body**, which asserts a default the trait does not have —
//!   the half that costs somebody writing a custom lexer;
//! * `Syntax::{COMPONENTS, REQUIRED}` written `: ArraySize` where both carry
//!   `ArraySize + Debug + Eq + Hash`.
//!
//! `GUIDE_EVENT_CENSUS` (`cst/event.rs`) is the shape that closes this class, and this module is
//! that shape generalised. The generalisation is one change: **the coupling moves out of Rust and
//! into the chapter.** The event census hard-codes chapter, heading spelling and enum name in
//! Rust, which is right for one enumeration and is 45 copies of itself for 45 digests. Here each
//! digest names its own subject in an HTML comment above the fence — invisible in rustdoc and in
//! the mdbook build — and this file is the one reader.
//!
//! ```text
//! <!-- api-digest: Lexer; complete; alias TokenError = <Self::Token as Token<'inp>>::Error -->
//! ```
//!
//! # What the census asserts
//!
//! For every annotated digest, at the strongest level the digest's own text supports:
//!
//! 1. **Membership** — every member the digest names is declared by the item. With `complete`,
//!    every member the item declares is named by the digest.
//! 2. **Required versus defaulted** — a member written with a body asserts a default; one written
//!    `;` asserts none. Both directions are checked.
//! 3. **Signature identity, modulo declared elision** — receiver, parameter types positionally,
//!    return type, associated-type bounds, associated-const type.
//!
//! # What makes an elision legible rather than tolerated
//!
//! A digest elides on purpose and the census must not fight that. Four elisions are **declared**,
//! meaning the census reads a mark in the text and narrows what it checks at exactly that spot:
//!
//! | written | means | census |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `…` in a bound list | the tail of the bounds is not shown | shown bounds must be a **subset** |
//! | `..` in a parameter list or type argument | that position is not shown | that type is not compared |
//! | `_` as a type | that type is not shown | that type is not compared |
//! | `alias X = <ty>` in the annotation | `X` is the digest's shorthand for `<ty>` | `X` is substituted before parsing |
//!
//! and two equivalences are **tolerated**, each a well-defined one rather than slack:
//!
//! * a method's generics and `where` clause are never compared, because dropping
//!   `where L: Lexer<'inp>` is the house style and it is legible;
//! * a leading lowercase path segment is dropped from every type spelling, so `super::Source`,
//!   `core::fmt::Debug` and `crate::error::ErrorNode` compare equal to `Source`, `Debug` and
//!   `ErrorNode` — the same item reached by a different in-scope path. The residue this leaves is
//!   real and worth naming: the census cannot tell `a::Foo` from `b::Foo`.
//!
//! Anything else the census cannot read is **refused**, never skipped — a fence whose body will
//! not parse, an alias that never fires, a member with no declaration behind it, a clause the
//! annotation grammar does not have. A census that silently covers less than it claims is the
//! defect class this module exists for.
//!
//! `names-only` is the one downgrade, for a digest written as prose rather than as Rust
//! (`fn rewind(.., u64);`, `fn enter_label / exit_label`). It keeps level 1 in both directions —
//! which is what catches a missing member — and gives up 2 and 3. It is a word in the tree, so it
//! shows in a diff, and the census still refuses any line of such a digest it cannot read.
//!
//! # Coverage, and what it does not reach
//!
//! The population is derived, not remembered: the census walks `src/`, finds every non-compiled
//! fence whose body re-declares a name the crate declares as a `pub trait`, and requires each to
//! be either annotated or named in `PENDING`. A digest added to the guide with neither reds.
//!
//! That keys on a `trait <Name>` line, and that is the whole of the guarantee. Three shapes sit
//! outside it, each derived from the tree rather than recalled, and each is a place a digest can
//! arrive without the coverage assertion noticing:
//!
//! * **A headless excerpt** — a fence quoting members without their header, the way
//!   `arch_parsing_engine.md` quotes three of `Lexer`'s. Four exist. Nothing in such a fence says
//!   which item it belongs to, so an annotation is the only thing that can attribute it, and one
//!   arriving unannotated is invisible here.
//! * **A struct or enum digest** — nine in the guide (`Checkpoint`, `InputRef`, `ParserContext`,
//!   `Recoverable`, the three Pratt step enums, `PrattFoldOp`, `Expected`). The comparison is the
//!   same shape over fields and variants instead of trait members, and is not written. The name
//!   test is weaker there too: `struct Parser` and `enum Expected` occur in *example* code as
//!   well, so a discovery rule keyed on struct names would flag three fences that re-declare
//!   nothing of the crate's.
//! * **A callback-shape digest** — `ch05_pratt.md` and `ref_pratt.md` twice quote the shapes of
//!   the `fold_prefix` / `fold_infix` / `fold_postfix` arguments to `InputRef::pratt`. Those are
//!   bounds on generic parameters rather than members of any item, so there is nothing to resolve
//!   them against; no level of this census reaches them.
//!
//! # Where it runs
//!
//! Gated on `feature = "std"`, and deliberately **not** on the guide's own
//! `all(std, logos_0_16, combinators)`. The census reads files, so it needs `std::fs`; it needs
//! nothing else, and only `std` gates whether `std::fs` exists, since `extern crate alloc as std`
//! is what `std` names in a no-std build. Wearing the guide's cfg would run it under
//! `--all-features` alone — one leg of the four the doctest matrix drives, and one of the two CI
//! runs tests on. As written it runs in all four (`rowan` implies `std`, so even the
//! `logos,rowan` leg carries it) and in both CI test legs.
//!
//! A leg with `std` off skips it silently, which is why
//! `the_guide_digests_agree_with_the_items_they_quote` pins the number of digests checked and the
//! number discovered: a filtered run that matches nothing exits `ok`, and so does a census whose
//! readers found nothing at all.
//!
//! # Not a Miri subject
//!
//! The five tests below carry `cfg_attr(miri, ignore)`, each with its own reason string. Miri
//! exists to find undefined behaviour, and this module gives it none to find: no `unsafe`, no
//! pointer or aliasing behaviour, nothing but `std::fs`, `include_str!`, and a `syn` parse of
//! source text. Interpreting that under Miri finds nothing, and it cost hours.
//!
//! On the last Miri run before this module existed — #339 @ `c09692f`, run 33251809138, all 25
//! jobs green — the two `--lib` shards for each target and borrow model (the ones that would go on
//! to compile this module) ran 1h23m–1h49m under Stacked Borrows and 2h33m–4h39m under Tree
//! Borrows. `#341` (`4bdc529`) added this module, and every Miri run since — including the run
//! against this repository's own `main` — has reported `cancelled=12, success=13`: exactly those
//! twelve `--lib` shards (`ci/miri_shard.py` puts `--lib` on shard 0 for the `logos` pass and
//! shard 1 for the `raw` pass) now hit GitHub's default job ceiling — a cancelled run's annotation
//! reads "exceeded the maximum execution time of 6h0m0s" — and `miri.yml` sets no
//! `timeout-minutes` of its own, so a run that cannot finish is reported `cancelled` rather than
//! `failed`.
//!
//! This is the crate's first use of `cfg_attr(miri, ignore)`; the next module reaching for the
//! same exemption should read this note rather than re-derive it, and should reach for it only
//! when, like this one, it has no UB for Miri to find — being slow is not by itself the qualifying
//! condition.
