//! Error collection container that adapts to allocation environments.
//!
//! This module provides the `Errors` type for collecting multiple errors during parsing
//! or validation. The container automatically adapts based on available features:
//!
//! - **no_std (no alloc)**: Uses `ConstArrayDeque<E, 2>` with fixed capacity of 2 errors
//! - **alloc/std**: Uses `VecDeque<E>` for unlimited error collection
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ## Basic Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! use tokora::error::Errors;
//!
//! let mut errors = Errors::new();
//! errors.push("First error");
//! errors.push("Second error");
//!
//! assert_eq!(errors.len(), 2);
//! assert!(!errors.is_empty());
//! ```
//!
//! ## Iteration
//!
//! ```rust
//! use tokora::error::Errors;
//!
//! let mut errors = Errors::new();
//! errors.push(1);
//! errors.push(2);
//!
//! let sum: i32 = errors.iter().sum();
//! assert_eq!(sum, 3);
//! ```

/// Default error container for no-alloc environments.
///
/// Uses a stack-allocated `ConstArrayDeque` with capacity for 2 errors.

pub type DefaultContainer<E> = VecDeque<E>;

/// A collection of errors that adapts to the allocation environment.
///
/// This type is generic over both the error type `E` and the container `C`.
/// By default:
/// - In no-alloc environments: Uses `ConstArrayDeque<E, 2>` (capacity of 2)
/// - In alloc/std environments: Uses `VecDeque<E>` (unlimited capacity)
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `E`: The error type to store
/// - `C`: The container type (defaults to environment-appropriate container)
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Using Default Container
///
/// ```rust
/// use tokora::error::Errors;
///
/// let mut errors = Errors::new();
/// errors.push("Error 1");
/// errors.push("Error 2");
///
/// assert_eq!(errors.len(), 2);
/// ```
///
/// ## Type Inference
///
/// ```rust
/// use tokora::error::Errors;
///
/// // Type inference works seamlessly
/// let mut errors = Errors::new();
/// errors.push("Error 1");
/// errors.push("Error 2");
///
/// let first: Option<&&str> = errors.front();
/// assert_eq!(first, Some(&"Error 1"));
/// ```
/// # Why there is no mutable door onto the container
///
/// `overflowed_flag` is wrapper metadata about something the container does not record: that an
/// error was *offered* and did not fit. Only an insertion can create that fact, so only the
/// wrapper's own insertion gateway ([`push`](Self::push) / [`try_push`](Self::try_push)) can
/// maintain it — and a `DerefMut`/`AsMut<C>` onto `C` handed callers the container's own
/// insertion API, through which a bounded container rejects a value and
/// [`overflowed`](Self::overflowed) never learns of it (al8n/tokora#247). Both doors are gone.
/// Documenting the obligation was the alternative, and it is the kind of promise the compiler
/// does not keep: the flag cannot be *derived* from the container either, because a full
/// container and a full container that has refused ten errors are the same container.
///
/// What survives is everything that cannot invent that fact: the shared views
/// ([`Deref`](core::ops::Deref), [`AsRef`](core::convert::AsRef)), in-place element mutation
/// ([`iter_mut`](Self::iter_mut), and `AsMut<[E]>` where the container is contiguous), and
/// removal ([`pop`](Self::pop), [`clear`](Self::clear)) — removal cannot un-drop an error, so
/// the flag is a historical fact and stays set.
///
/// `C` is the caller's own type and Rust has no bound that excludes interior mutability, so a
/// container that mutates itself through `&self` will do so through the shared views. **It is a
/// logic error for the container to be modified, after it is wrapped, in a way that changes what
/// this type reports** — the same obligation
/// [`HashSet`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html) states for a key,
/// and, like it, the behavior that follows is unspecified rather than undefined and is
/// deliberately not enumerated.
///
/// # Construction is an insertion door too
///
/// Removing the mutable views closed every door that *mutates* an already-wrapped container. It
/// did not close the ones that *build* one, and a truncating construction reaches the same lie
/// by a route that mutates nothing: the container arrives already full, already short, and the
/// flag is initialised to `false` (al8n/tokora#284). So the conversions that are handed **errors**
/// — [`FromIterator`] and [`From<E>`](From) — are bounded on
/// [`ErrorContainer`](super::ErrorContainer) and take the container's own accounting answer:
/// [`From<E>`](From) offers its one error to [`try_push`](Self::try_push), and `FromIterator`
/// hands the whole iterator to
/// [`ErrorContainer::from_errors`](super::ErrorContainer::from_errors), which is a loop of that
/// same [`try_push`](Self::try_push) unless the container overrides it, and which reports what
/// the container refused either way. `FromIterator` is the case that made it worth a bound: it
/// has no channel for reporting a value the container refused, so a bounded `C` collecting more
/// errors than it holds can only drop them, and `collect()` is read as lossless.
///
/// [`from_container`](Self::from_container) is the one construction door that is **not** an
/// insertion door, and the difference is who did the dropping. There the caller builds the
/// container and hands it over whole; the wrapper cannot know its history and no type could, so
/// the flag starts `false` and covers only what is offered afterwards. That obligation is
/// discharge-able rather than residual — a caller filling a bounded container *from errors* has
/// `collect()`, `From`, `push` and `try_push`, all of which account — and it is stated on that
/// method.

/// # Why the funnel is the *default* rather than the mechanism

/// Offering the errors one at a time is what makes the count honest, and for a bounded container

/// to show for it, and the tax is not a constant factor: `Vec`'s and `VecDeque`'s own
/// `FromIterator` specialise on a `Vec`/`VecDeque` `IntoIter` and take the source's allocation
/// outright, where a per-item fill has to hold the source buffer alive beside an equally large
/// destination until the last error is copied across. Over a million `u64` that is a peak of twice
/// the source instead of once it.
///
/// **Peak is not the axis that matters.** Between roughly one and two times the source in
/// available memory, the delegated fill completes and a per-item one asks for a second buffer it
/// cannot get — and a failed allocation is not a diagnostic. It is `handle_alloc_error`, which
/// aborts the process. So the funnel does not make an unbounded `collect()` slower, it roughly
/// halves the largest error count that survives at a given ceiling. Measured at a 12 MiB ceiling:
/// 1 572 864 errors collected, against 786 432 for the per-item fill, and the difference is an
/// abort rather than a truncation.
///
/// So the choice of fill is [`ErrorContainer::from_errors`](super::ErrorContainer::from_errors), a
/// bulk-construction hook on the container that **defaults to that per-item funnel** and returns
/// the overflow state alongside the container. A container that leaves it alone accounts exactly
/// as before; `Vec` and `VecDeque` override it with their own `FromIterator` and report `false`,
/// which is sound because neither can refuse an error rather than because std specialises. If the
/// specialisation ever stops firing, an unbounded `collect()` costs what the funnel costs today —
/// the improvement rests on it, never the accounting.
///
/// **The hook trusts the container no further than [`try_push`](Errors::try_push) already does.**
/// An override that keeps only what fits and answers `false` makes
/// [`overflowed`](Errors::overflowed) report clean over dropped errors — which is precisely what a
/// `try_push` that answers `Ok(())` after dropping the error does, on a trait whose whole purpose
