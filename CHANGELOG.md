# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate are documented here. The project follows semantic
versioning; before 1.0, a minor bump (0.x → 0.(x+1)) signals a breaking change.

<!--
Cross-references inside this file NEVER use a bare GitHub heading slug. Six headings here
are spelled `### Changed (breaking)` and seven `### Added`; GitHub numbers duplicate slugs in
document order, so `#changed-breaking` means "whichever one comes first today" and prepending
a section silently re-points every link that used it. It has happened: 53 references into
0.8.0 came to point at a one-item stub the moment `## Unreleased` was opened above them.

So a link target is an explicit anchor, declared on its own line one blank line above the
heading it names, and named `<section-key>-<heading-slug>`:

    ### Changed (breaking)

- **`SyntaxTreeBuilder::finish` returns `Result<rowan::GreenNode, cst::FinishError>`, and
  `checkpoint`/`start_node_at` trade `rowan::Checkpoint` for `cst::TreeCheckpoint`** (#316). The
  builder drives `rowan` directly with no event log behind it, so nothing else can bound what it
  constructs; it now carries `MAX_TREE_DEPTH` itself. An open that would cross the ceiling is not
  forwarded, the builder latches, and `finish` reports `FinishError::TooDeep` instead of handing
  back a value nobody can drop. Migration is `.finish()` → `.finish().expect(...)` or a real
  match, and `let cp = builder.checkpoint()` is unchanged at the call site — only its type is.

  **Two simpler ledgers were tried and both are wrong, which is why the checkpoint type had to
  change.** A live open-count — the nodes `rowan` is holding now — is blind to `start_node_at`,
  which nests on top of subtrees that are already *finished*: checkpoint, build a chain to the
  ceiling, close it, wrap, and the live count is zero at the wrap while the tree is one level past
  the ceiling. A per-level maximum fixes that and converts **width into phantom depth**: a wrap
  swallows only the children added after *its own* checkpoint, so charging it the deepest child the
  level ever completed put each sibling's depth into the next sibling's charge, and the charge fed
  back into the level when the wrap closed. A flat row of one-token wraps — real depth 2, forever —
  climbed one phantom level per sibling and latched past the thousandth, discarding a perfectly
  droppable tree. `a_row_of_sibling_wraps_is_two_levels_deep_however_many_there_are` is that row.

  The population is *the children after this checkpoint*, and nothing weaker names it — hence a
  tokora-owned checkpoint, which wraps `rowan`'s opaque one beside the child index the charge needs.
  The ledger then mirrors `rowan`'s own **flat** child stream in depths, so a wrap's charge is `max`
  over exactly the range `rowan` will drain into it: exact, not an approximation.

  **That is also the whole answer to a checkpoint spent twice, out of order, or after its node
  closed.** Such a use is either one `rowan` refuses — its two asserts fire before the ledger is
  touched, because the forward happens first — or one it accepts, and then it wraps exactly
  `children[cp..]`, which is the range the charge was computed over. There is no level bookkeeping
  to disagree with the tree, because there is no level bookkeeping; five cells hold the cases.

  **The ledger is bounded by the ceiling, not by the caller's width, and the bound is asserted.**
  Storing that flat vector outright would be one `usize` per child `rowan` already holds. Every
  query is a suffix maximum, so only the entries that can answer one are kept — index `i` while its
  depth exceeds every later depth. Retained depths are strictly decreasing and each is at most
  `MAX_TREE_DEPTH`, so the structure holds at most `MAX_TREE_DEPTH + 1` entries however wide the
  input; over the row of `MAX_TREE_DEPTH + 64` siblings it measures **4**.

and referenced as `[16](#0.8.0-changed-breaking)`. The blank line is required. CommonMark
reads `<a id="…"></a>` as a paragraph of inline HTML, and a renderer that instead reads a
lone tag on its own line as an HTML *block* would swallow the line below it — the blank line
is correct under both readings, and it gives the gate one deterministic place to look.

When `## Unreleased` becomes `## <version> (date)` at a tag, the section key changes from
`unreleased` to that version, so its anchors and every link to them change key with it. Do not
write the next release's number down anywhere it can be overtaken — `ci/changelog_structure.sh`
refuses two sections sharing a key, and a hard-coded `0.9.0` in the selftest's own fixture went
red the day this section became `0.9.0`. `ci/changelog_structure.sh` enforces every clause above
and will red until they do.

## 0.11.0 (2026-09-15)

### Breaking

- Switch from `generic-arraydeque` to `hybrid-arraydeque`

## 0.10.0 (2026-08-29)

### Added

- **`PrattRHS::Adjacent` — an infix continuation spelled with no token** (#274). Juxtaposition as
  an *operator* rather than as a repetition: the shape LogQL's `labelFilter labelFilter` needs,
  where the same connective is also spelled `and`, `,` and `|` and the empty one has to compete
  with those three on the same ladder. A repetition dissolves into a `while` loop at the
  production and needs nothing from the driver; an operator does, because its right operand's
  floor has to be the **driver's**. The workaround this replaces — report the already-parsed right
  operand as a `Postfix` — gives that floor to the production, where none of the driver's
  precedence laws reach it.

  **The report is exempt from "consume what you report", and the right operand pays instead —
  twice.** There is no operator spelling for a report boundary to measure, and consuming nothing is
  the point (consuming trivia before deciding is legal too — that is the CST-shaped classifier). So
  the driver charges the operand at the two points a zero-token continuation can be held to it, and
  both refusals are a terminal `UnexpectedEoRhs` plus a `debug_assert` naming which one fired:

  - **the charge**, read when the operand parse returns and **before the fold, the CST wrap and the
    next turn**, which is the work a continuation buys. It refuses a continuation whose right
    operand advanced nothing past where the classifier left the input.
  - **the debt**, read before the descent. The charge is frame-local and runs on the way back up,
    so on its own it prices nothing the way down already built.

  **Both are measured from where the report crossed back, not from where the cycle started, and
  that is the exemption's other half** (#323). An exempt classifier may legally have consumed on
  its way to the report, and those bytes pay the adjacency its frame is *already inside* — never
  the one it is reporting. Bytes taken before the report discharge the debt the frames above are
  owed, bytes taken after it pay for this continuation, and every byte pays exactly one of the two.
  Measured from the top of the cycle the same trivia paid twice and in both directions at once: it
  satisfied the charge with input the right operand never consumed — a fold, a wrap and another
  turn for bytes that were the operator's — while staying invisible to the debt test, which is the
  one obligation it really does discharge, so a legal parse was refused and refused *terminally*.
  The structural bound survives and tightens, since the report boundary is never behind the
  position the cycle started from.

  A grammar that can answer a zero-width operand, which every recovering grammar can, is the one
  that reaches either.

  **It is left-associative and offers no choice, and that is half of the depth bound rather than a
  default.** The payload is the `Infix` arm's left-associative operator type, the fold sees
  `PrattInfix::Left`, and the driver descends on `> power`. An inclusive bound would admit the
  operator's own power into its right operand, so an inner frame handed the same zero-token
  continuation reports it again and descends **with nothing consumed** — one native frame per
  level, paid for by no byte of the document and bounded only by the recursion budget. On the
  exclusive bound the inner frame declines it, the chain iterates in one frame, and the charge
  prices every turn.

  What that leaves open is a chain of *strictly increasing* powers, and that is the grammar's
  ladder only while the powers come from the grammar. `ParsePrattRHS` is a parser the grammar
  constructs and may hold state, so a contract-valid classifier can make the powers a function of
  the input: escalate at every level over zero-width operands, consume one byte in the deepest
  frame, and that byte is past the position every ancestor descended from and satisfies all of
  their charges at once — after k frames, k folds and k CST wraps have already happened. So the
  driver carries the committed position of the nearest outstanding continuation into the
  recursion and refuses another zero-token descent until committed consumption — the reporting
  classifier's own included — has **strictly** passed it, replacing it with the position its own
  report left the input at on the way down. One advancement therefore discharges exactly one
  adjacency, and along any path from the outermost continuation inward the descents sit at
  strictly increasing committed offsets: **never more `Adjacent` frames than bytes between the
  first and the last**, structurally rather than by measurement.

  Pinned three ways in `tests/pratt_adjacent.rs`, all of them counts rather than errors — the
  recursion limiter reaches an error too, and a bound that is really the limiter's would look the
  same: the refused cycle enters the LHS channel twice rather than once per budget level; a chain
  four times longer than the budget parses in one frame; and an escalating classifier over a
  one-byte document builds two frames and no fold where an unbounded driver builds one frame and
  one fold per rung and returns `Ok`. Three further cells run a classifier that *does* consume
  before reporting, one per measurement that sits on the report boundary, so reverting any single
  one of them to the top of the cycle reds exactly one cell and leaves the other two — and the
  paying ladder that is their control — green.

  **The token-level engine (`InputRef::pratt`) does not serve it.** Its termination argument is
  that acceptance *is* the commit of one nonzero-width token, and its `fold_infix` is handed a
  real token; neither survives a zero-token operator. It raises the end-of-RHS diagnostic and
  returns the left-hand side — the posture it already takes for an infix whose right operand never
  arrived — rather than parking the report and ending the expression with a silent `Ok`.

  **Only an admitted, non-repeating adjacency reaches that refusal.** The report carries a power,
  and the engine applies its floor and its non-associative-chain constraint to it first, exactly as
  it does to a spelled infix: an adjacency below the floor belongs to the surrounding grammar and
  is handed back without a diagnostic, and one at the power of a `Neither` operator the frame just
  folded is `NonAssociativeChain` — non-terminal, the token left on the input, a recoverer's to
  spend. Either one, refused as an unsupported shape instead, rejects an otherwise valid embedded
  parse while leaving the token unconsumed.

- **`types::Status`, and `with_status` on all nineteen recovery carriers** (#320). The recovery
  state stops being a private field and becomes a value a consumer can hold: it is returned by
  `IntoComponents` (see **Changed (breaking)**) and accepted back by
  `Ident::with_status`, `Keyword::with_status` and each `Lit*::with_status`, which are the inverses
  of that decomposition and make a decompose-and-rebuild the identity in all three states.

  `with_status` is also the only constructor that can express a state other than valid over a
  payload the **caller** chose — `new` always declares the result valid, and `ErrorNode::error` /
  `ErrorNode::missing` pick the payload themselves — so a dialect with its own placeholder
  spelling now has a door. Without it a complete decomposition would still have ended in
  laundering, because the only public way back in forced `Valid`.

  `Status` is `#[non_exhaustive]`: a fourth recovery state is admissible later, so a `match` needs
  a wildcard arm and `is_valid()` is deliberately not `!is_error() && !is_missing()`.

- **`types::recovery::FromComponents` — the inverse of `IntoComponents`** (#320).
  `T::from_components(x.into_components())` rebuilds a carrier with its recovery state intact, and
  is the door that closes the laundering: rebuilding through `new` would declare a recovered node
  valid.

  It is a **trait** method, and that is a repair rather than a style. The same job was briefly done
  by a `pub const fn with_status(span, payload, status)` inherent on each of the nineteen carriers,
  argued loud because its `Status` parameter is a type no pre-upgrade expression can produce.
  **That is false for a type-directed expression, and it was measured.** An unchanged
  `unsafe { core::mem::zeroed() }` in that argument position infers as a consumer's own status enum
  before the upgrade and as `Status` after; both revisions compile, there is no ambiguity, and
  dispatch moves from the consumer's trait to tokora's inherent function. With `Status::Valid` at
  discriminant zero, a consumer's zero-valued *rejection* becomes valid syntax.
  `transmute::<u8, _>(0)` does the same, and `MaybeUninit::uninit().assume_init()` yields whatever
  the stack held. Bounded routes were measured too and all fail loudly — `Default::default()`,
  `x.into()`, an associated constant and a bounded generic call each need an impl or a named type
  `Status` does not provide. The silent routes are exactly the **unbounded** ones.

  A trait method sits where a consumer's inherent item outranks it, its argument is an associated
  type rather than a bare `Status`, and `recovery` is not glob-re-exported — so it has to be named.
  No consumer code depends on the withdrawn spelling: `with_status` is new in this release and
  never shipped, which is why it goes where `Ident`'s predicates came back.

- **`types::recovery::{RecoveryState, Status}`, over all nineteen recovery carriers**
  (#301). `Keyword` and the seventeen literal carriers implemented `ErrorNode` — so
  `error(span)` and `missing(span)` were public and documented as recovery placeholders — while
  holding no field that could record which of the three states a value was in. The only way to
  tell a recovered node from one spelled out in the source was to compare its payload against
  the `"<error>"` / `"<missing>"` sentinel, which is a value a caller can spell by hand and edit
  afterwards through `source_mut` / `data_mut`.

  Each of the nineteen now carries the same private `Status` `Ident` has carried since #266, set
  by `new` (valid) and by the two `ErrorNode` constructors. The rule they are all keeping is
  stated once, on `ErrorNode` itself, under **Two Shapes of Implementor**: a *payload* type such
  as `&str` has nowhere to put a state and so its placeholder is a sentinel; a *carrier* type with
  fields of its own owes a status field. The trait's own diagnostics example used to demonstrate
  the sentinel comparison and now reads the state.

  **`Ident` keeps its three inherent predicates; the other eighteen carriers answer only through
  the trait.** That asymmetry is a rule applied to two histories rather than an oversight, and the
  rule is written beside the methods in `ident.rs`:

  > Do not change resolution for a name that already shipped; do not create a new resolution
  > hazard for a name that did not.

  `Ident::is_valid` has been inherent since #266, and an inherent method **wins** the pick over an
  extension trait's — so a downstream crate with its own `is_valid` for `Ident` has been getting
  tokora's answer. Removing the inherent one does not merely cost them an import: the call still
  compiles, with no ambiguity, and silently falls through to theirs. It falls the dangerous way,
  too, since a check that merely accepts a non-empty payload reads `Ident::error(span)`'s
  `"<error>"` as valid syntax. A draft of this release did remove them, on the argument that the
  declared channel should not have two spellings; that argument is about how the surface reads,
  and this one is about existing code changing meaning with nothing to catch it. They are not the
  same weight.

  **`is_valid`, `is_error` and `is_missing` are on `RecoveryState` for the other eighteen**, which
  never had the names, and that is the point rather than a detail.

  `IdentList` keeps its three as inherent methods and does **not** implement the trait. They are
  not the same question either: a list is an aggregate, and `is_error` and `is_missing` can both
  be true of one at once, which no single `Status` can say. Those three names are ones a downstream crate may
  already have on an extension trait of its own — "this literal's payload parses as a number" —
  and Rust prefers an inherent method over a trait's at an unqualified call site. Shipping them
  inherent would have left `literal.is_valid()` compiling and quietly answering a different
  question after an upgrade, with no diagnostic anywhere. On a trait the clash is
  `error[E0034]: multiple applicable items in scope` naming both candidates, or no change at all
  for a consumer who does not import ours. Widening `IntoComponents` rather than withdrawing it
  was justified below by exactly this standard — that a change of meaning must not be silent —
  and these methods are the case it would otherwise have excluded.

  **`status` is on the trait too, and there is no inherent accessor of any name.** It was briefly
  inherent, kept there to stay `const fn`, on the reasoning that a return type which did not exist
  before could not be displaced silently. That reasoning is wrong, and the counterexample is one
  line: `literal.status().is_valid()` typechecks either way, because `Status` offers `is_valid`
  too — a differing return type is only loud if the caller *stores* the value. Since `new` marks
  any caller-supplied payload `Valid`, a literal the consumer's own check would have rejected then
  passes.

  So the test a name has to survive is not *does the signature differ* but **does the whole call
  chain still typecheck with a different meaning**, and an inherent accessor of any name fails it
  whenever the two returned types share a method.

  **The cost is that the recovery state is not readable in a const context**, by any spelling,
  because a trait method cannot be `const`. Nothing in this crate read it in one, and a parse
  result is not const-constructible in practice. Two ways to keep it were available and both are
  worse: a `pub` field is a public *setter*, and `x.status = Status::Valid` would launder a
  placeholder into valid syntax by assignment — the whole defect this type closes; a receiver-less
  associated function escapes method syntax but is still displaced in path position, trading a
  certainty for an improbability, and resting on the class of reasoning that was just wrong.

- **`cst::TreeCheckpoint` — the builder's own checkpoint, carrying the one number `rowan`'s does
  not** (#316). Returned by `SyntaxTreeBuilder::checkpoint` and spent by `start_node_at`; it wraps
  `rowan::Checkpoint` beside the flat child index the depth ledger charges a retro-wrap against.
  See **Changed (breaking)** for why the opaque one could not stay.

- **`cst::MAX_TREE_DEPTH`, `cst::MIN_SUPPORTED_STACK` and `cst::FinishError::TooDeep` — the
  ceiling that keeps a green tree droppable, the stack it is derived against, and the refusal
  that enforces it** (#316). 1024 nested nodes, root wrapper counted, on a thread of at least
  2 MiB.
  `rowan` releases a green tree **recursively**, so a deep enough one ends the process in its own
  destructor: an abort, with no unwind, no diagnostic and nothing to catch. Nothing downstream can
  defend against it — by the time a consumer holds the tree, its existence is the hazard — so the
  refusal is raised before the tree exists, at every door: `Cst::finish`, `Cst::finish_partial`
  and `SyntaxTreeBuilder::finish`.

  **The value is measured, not inherited.** One chain of nested nodes around a single token,
  finished and released on an explicitly sized 2 MiB thread, one trial per process, bisected for
  the greatest depth that returns before the next dies with `fatal runtime error: stack overflow`
  — `rowan 0.17.0`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `rustc 1.100.0-nightly (8fa1c96cf 2026-08-17)`. The
  binding cell over green release, red-root release, green `Display` and red `text()` is **4388**
  in debug (~477 B/level) and 9410 in release (~222 B). 1024 is the deepest power of two that
  clears the debug row by `MIN_HEADROOM`, and the `const` block beside the constant pins that
  derivation from both sides rather than admitting a band. One number for both profiles, on
  `PARSE_DEFAULT_DEPTH`'s own argument and more strongly: the frames are `rowan`'s, so their
  optimisation is the *dependency's*, which `cfg!(debug_assertions)` here cannot observe at all.

  **The 2 MiB is a requirement, not a measurement condition, and saying so is half the change.**
  Neither door requires that stack nor can check what is left of it — `std` reports remaining
  stack nowhere portably — so `MIN_SUPPORTED_STACK` publishes the figure the ceiling is derived
  against and the `const` block ties the two together in *bytes*, against the same
  `measured::STACK` every other stack figure in this crate is stated on. Below it, a tree this
  crate **accepted** aborts when dropped; so does the one a **refusal** drops, because a refused
  build is still holding everything it built up to the ceiling. Both halves are now run rather
  than argued: two cells build at the ceiling on a thread of exactly `MIN_SUPPORTED_STACK` and
  take both outcomes through both doors. Planted at 256 KiB, each half — accept, and refusal
  alone — dies with `fatal runtime error: stack overflow, aborting`, which is what makes the
  cells sharp and the contract real.

  It is still a constant and not a knob, and the argument had to be corrected rather than
  repeated: the first version said a caller who lowered it "would break nothing real", which
  reads as *nobody would want to*. The caller on a 256 KiB worker would. What answers them is
  not a per-call ceiling but that the same thread cannot run this crate's parser either — the
  shipped `PARSE_DEFAULT_DEPTH` models 1.25 MiB of native parse frames against this ceiling's
  477 KiB of drop, so the tree ceiling is never the binding term in the crate's stack contract.
  A caller who raised the ceiling would be configuring the abort back in.

  **What actually reaches it is not deep nesting.** `Pratt::with_cst_kinds` mints one retro-wrap
  anchor per expression and spends it once per fold, and same-target wraps nest inside-out — the
  correct shape for a left-associative chain, and one whose tree depth is **linear in the operator
  count**. `1 + 1 + 1 + …` is one recursion level, one open node in the event log, and `n` nested
  nodes in the tree; no recursion budget bounds it because no recursion happens. So a flat
  expression past 1024 operators is now refused with `TooDeep`. The alternative was never
  "accepted" — it was the abort, at roughly four times that depth. Lifting the ceiling needs a
  green tree whose release is not recursive, which is #252's decision and not a number.

  Every recursion budget this crate ships or publishes fits under the ceiling
  (`PARSE_DEFAULT_DEPTH` 32, `OPTIMIZED_PARSE_DEPTH` 256), asserted at compile time; the deepest
  tree this crate's own CST corpus materializes is **4** over the default 256 seeds and **6** over
  the 50 000-seed sweep, both asserted live so the margin cannot go stale in prose. The bound is
  pinned at the deep sweep's figure, and the reason is a defect worth recording: it was pinned at
  the *default* corpus's maximum for one revision and enforced over every case, including the
  larger sweep. The sweep is `#[ignore]`d and only `test (release)` runs it, so the failure read
  as profile-dependent and was not — the deep sweep panics identically in debug and the default
  corpus passes identically in release. Two populations run one assertion; the bound belongs to
  the larger.

- **`TokenBudgetTally::refused_an_item` — the one question a host that caught an unwind and
  concluded can still ask.** A budget refusal has **no diagnostic channel** (a diagnostic would have to be
  built as the emitter's own error type, which needs a `From` bound this crate deliberately does not
  add to every consume path), and `InputRef::next` folds a terminal stop into `Ok(None)`. The
  in-band carriers — `Input::scanner_trips` and the poison boundary — are published before any
  consumer code runs, so an ordinary parse always sees them. What they cannot reach is a host that
  catches an unwind out of **its own** code (an `L::Offset` destructor, a `Cache` method,
  `Lexer::span`) and then concludes without re-entering the scanner: nothing crate-side runs there
  again, so every in-band signal is by definition unavailable. This accessor is the answer for that
  host — *was this input truncated by the budget?* — and it is the same durable bit the driver's own
  refusal gate reads: written at the refusal, in front of every consumer step the refusal runs, not
  a `Checkpoint` field, not reached by the state re-key, with no `token_budget_mut` to lower it.

  **Three bounds, each of which limits what a reading licenses.** It witnesses **this budget only**
  — the lexer's own limit trip, latched off `Lexer::check`, never writes it, and could not, since
  that tally lives in `L::State` and a `Checkpoint` carries it; so `false` means *the budget refused
  nothing*, not *the parse was not truncated*. It is **input-absolute, not attempt-relative** —
  it says an item was refused somewhere in the life of this `Input`, never *inside my window*, which
  is what `scanner_trips` against a baseline answers and what every in-crate reader of terminality
  uses. And it **does not survive a `PartialSession` redrive**, which builds a fresh `Input` and a
  fresh tally; what carries a refusal across attempts is the session's own terminal latch.

  **The third bound was written here while it was false**, and the type split under **Changed
  (breaking)** is what makes it true: supply a copied budget as the next attempt's context and the
  witness used to survive. All three are now cells rather than sentences —
  `a_lexer_limit_trip_is_terminal_and_the_budget_witness_stays_false`,
  `the_witness_is_absolute_and_says_nothing_about_the_window_it_is_read_in`, and
  `a_redrive_starts_its_tally_at_zero_and_lexes`.

  Read it through `InputRef::token_budget`, which is already `pub`; there is still no
  `token_budget_mut`.

- **`InputRef::at_scanner_stop` — the scanner half of "does this failure end the document",
  readable on the one exit no error value reaches** (#311). A **rejecting** (fail-fast) `Emitter`
  reports a lexer-resource trip by *returning* the value its `From<<L::Token as Token>::Error>`
  builds — that `Err` **is** the report, not a refusal to make one — and `scan_with(..)?`
  propagates it from **inside** `try_expect_or_stop`, before that call can reach the arm raising a
  terminal-marked `UnexpectedEot`. A document-root loop then holds an ordinary-looking grammar
  error over an exhausted scanner, and **no care in the grammar's `MaybeTerminal` repairs it**:
  there is nothing terminal-marked on that path to delegate to, and calling `try_expect_or_stop`
  does not help because the unmarked error originates inside that call.

  The stop is nonetheless already **on record** when that `Err` arrives. The poison boundary is
  latched inside the crate's terminal predicate, ahead of the diagnostic ever being offered to the
  emitter — that ordering exists precisely so an emitter's answer cannot decide whether the input
  remembers its own stop. This method reads it, together with the input-layer `TokenBudget`'s
  recorded refusal (`TokenBudgetTally::refused_an_item`, in the entry above) which no re-key can
  clear.

  **It is a reading of *now*, not a baseline-and-compare, and that is the whole design.** It takes
  no argument, so there is no baseline for a caller to place wrongly, and it witnesses no event, so
  there is no comparison of a rollbackable cell to prove at any nesting depth.

  **What it is not is "what the next call would do", and the contract now says so.** The gate
  drains a **cached** token before it consults either fact, and the budget half is durable and
  non-positional — so with a lookahead's tokens still waiting at the front this answers `true`
  while `try_expect_or_stop` hands one of them out. Measured: a `TokenBudget` of two and a
  `peek::<U4>` over eight tokens leave the reading `true` and the very next call returning
  `Ok(Some(_))` (`a_refusal_on_record_still_has_cached_tokens_in_front_of_it`). A `true` means *the
  stream is truncated*, never *stop draining*.

  **And it is narrowly a live query, which two other public contracts take out from under a
  caller.** `state_mut`/`set_state` drop the poison boundary — the documented limit-recovery path —
  and every speculative wrapper (`try_attempt`, `attempt_parse`, a rollback-on-drop `Transaction`,
  a raw `restore`) reinstates a checkpoint that predates the trip. Both leave this reading clean
  while the scanner may still be stopped, so a root loop is left with an ordering obligation —
  read it before the re-key, and inside the wrapper — that a loop whose elements speculate cannot
  always meet. `InputRef::scanner_stopped_during_attempt`, in the entry below, is the
  attempt-relative reading that carries no such obligation.

  **Publishing `scanner_trip_snapshot` / `scanner_tripped_during_attempt` would not have closed
  this, and the entry above records why.** `set_state` / `state_mut` re-key the input's
  forward-scanning facts, and dropping the poison boundary there is the **documented**
  limit-recovery path; the counter is monotone and neither touches it, so a fully recovered document
  reads as truncated. That is now pinned, not argued: planting the counter reading in this method's
  place reds `a_documented_widening_leaves_the_witness_reporting_a_finished_document` at `Err(Eot)`
  for an `Ok(7)`. The live reading goes clean there because the regime that owned the stop is gone.

  **Measured in both directions**, in `tokora/tests/root_loop_trip_witness.rs` section 4. Without
  the reading, a root loop that meets an ordinary-looking failure by re-keying the lexer regime —
  which is what `state_mut` is for, and which drops the boundary — retries against a tally that is
  still spent and files **one diagnostic per remaining token**, at three document lengths; with it,
  zero at every length, and the loop ends the document on the same turn. The non-vacuity control is
  the same pair under a budget nothing reaches: both loops read the whole document and file nothing.
  The two halves are pinned by disjoint cells — removing the boundary read reds the
  rejecting-emitter cells, removing the budget read reds
  `a_token_budget_refusal_outlives_the_re_key_that_clears_a_lexer_trip`.

  **What a `false` does not promise** is stated on the method: a cursor rewound behind a live
  boundary by a rollback reads clean — the region behind the frontier is replayable, so a loop that
  carries on re-parses a prefix that really is there and re-reaches the stop, but what bounds that
  is the loop **keeping** the prefix, and one whose retry is itself inside a rolling-back wrapper
  keeps nothing, consumes nothing and does not terminate. That is the shape the attempt-relative
  verdict below closes. And a *met* ceiling whose one-shot probe has not run yet reads clean (only
  running the lexer separates "would an item be refused" from "is there an item", and answering
  `true` there would report a fully-parsed document as truncated).

  The attempt-relative reading answers a different question — *did a trip happen inside the attempt
  I am judging, and is it still in force* — and it is the entry directly below. The **raw**
  `scanner_tripped_during_attempt` beside it stays crate-internal, because the drivers need the
  event unconditioned by that second clause.

- **`InputRef::scanner_trip_snapshot` / `InputRef::scanner_stopped_during_attempt` — the
  **attempt-relative** scanner verdict, rollback-safe and recovery-aware** (#311). Take the baseline
  once per collection, above the loop; read the verdict wherever the failure surfaces. Its baseline
  is `input::ScannerTripBaseline`, the scanner twin of `input::ResourceTripBaseline`, carrying the
  same nonce and the same `'closure` brand — a baseline judged against another input panics, and one
  cannot be stashed and carried into a later handle invocation, which is what would quietly turn the
  attempt-relative reading into a session-absolute one.

  **It exists because `at_scanner_stop` is a live query and two public contracts take the record
  away.** `state_mut`/`set_state` drop the poison boundary, and a speculative wrapper restores a
  checkpoint predating the trip. A loop that must read the verdict *before* its own re-key, and
  *inside* a wrapper several frames down, has an ordering obligation it cannot always meet.

  **The counter alone was never publishable, and the entry below records why**: it is monotone, so
  a loop that recovers exactly as documented reads its own finished document as truncated. What
  closes that is not a second cell ordered against the trip — the design that would have had to
  settle its own rollback behaviour at every nesting depth — but a second **question**, asked of
  the present: the trip event, conjoined with the stop still being in force *now*. Being a question
  rather than a record is what makes it need no ordering and no rollback proof.

  **Two carriers can hold a scanner stop and they clear on opposite terms**, so both are asked. A
  `TokenBudget` refusal is never cleared — no `Checkpoint` carries the tally, no re-key touches it,
  and there is no `token_budget_mut` — so for a bound placed there the verdict is durable by
  construction. A lexer-side trip clears exactly when the installed regime stops refusing.

  **The residue it closes** is the one `at_scanner_stop` names first: a lookahead trips, latches
  the frontier *ahead* of the committed cursor, and still returns `Ok` with a short window. Every
  positional witness reads clean there, and stays clean while the cached pre-trip tokens drain,
  because draining them never carries the cursor to the frontier. This reading is not positional —
  it asks whether a stop is latched at all — so it answers `true` from the moment the lookahead
  latched.

  **A `true` is sound rather than conservative.** Both publishers of a scanner trip require an item
  that exists — `latch_if_limit_tripped` is reached from `classify` about an item the lexer
  produced, and `settle_met_ceiling` discards its staged stop when `lex()` yields nothing — so a
  `true` means a real item is refused right now.

  **It is the stop question, and it is deliberately not a sufficient root-loop guard.** A trip
  inside a speculative wrapper is restored away *together with the tally that took it* — the refund
  `TokenLimiter` documents as the correct answer for a bound on the committed stream — so this
  answers `false`, correctly, while the caller still holds the trip-derived error at the position
  the attempt began. `InputRef::scanner_outcome`, in the entry below, is the shape a retrying loop
  matches on; this method is its `Stopped` arm and nothing more.

  **Measured in `tokora/tests/root_loop_trip_witness.rs` section 5**, whose lexer is deliberately
  not the earlier sections': it holds the crate's own `TokenLimiter` **by value**, which is the
  placement the `Lexer` determinism clause requires, where `SLexer`'s `Rc<Cell<_>>` tally is that
  clause's own named violation (*"a shared counter"*) and cannot decide a question about restores.
  The five-point table — latched ahead, draining, at the frontier, re-keyed, recovered — runs under
  **both** emitters and answers `(false, true)`, `(false, true)`, `(true, true)`, `(false, false)`,
  `(false, false)` against `at_scanner_stop`: the first two rows are the gain, and the last two are
  where a monotone counter would be a permanent false positive.

  **Costs** a nonce comparison and a `u64` comparison; then, only if those say a trip happened, a
  `bool` load and an `Option::is_some`. No scan, no lookahead fill, no caller code at all.

  The raw `scanner_tripped_during_attempt` stays crate-internal. The drivers need the event
  **unconditioned** — a driver judging one element must re-raise a trip it caught even where
  grammar code recovered the regime inside that element, which is precisely the conjunct the public
  verdict drops.

- **`InputRef::scanner_attempt` / `InputRef::scanner_outcome` — the root-loop guard, because a
  boolean cannot be one** (#311). Returns `input::ScannerOutcome`, a four-arm enum: `NoTrip`,
  `Stopped`, `Stalled`, `Progressed`. Take `input::ScannerAttempt` per **attempt**, at the top of
  the turn; match the outcome where the failure surfaces.

  **The failure that costs most is one where no stop is in force.** A failing `try_attempt` /
  `attempt_parse` / rollback-on-drop `Transaction` restores the checkpointed state and a pre-trip
  `None` boundary, and for a scanner bound held in the lexer state — the **supported** placement
  `TokenLimiter` documents, not a contract-violating shared counter — the input-side refusal bit is
  `false` as well. Every live reading of the input is then correctly clean, the caller nonetheless
  holds the trip-derived error, and the cursor and state are exactly where the attempt began. A loop
  guarded on `at_scanner_stop` or `scanner_stopped_during_attempt` retries the identical scan and can
  burn unbounded CPU on attacker-controlled input.

  **The partition is the `Lexer` determinism clause's own three inputs, and none of them needs a
  scan to read** — so no regime probe and no third `Lexer::lex` site. `Stalled` is *a trip, no stop
  in force, and all three inputs unchanged*: the source (constant), an offset **equal** to the
  capture's, and the same lexer regime. It is sound rather than heuristic, because that is exactly
  the clause's own precondition for a scan reproducing its result.

  Each way the third clause can fail is its **own arm** rather than folded into the stall, because
  they license opposite decisions. `ReKeyed` — the documented `set_state` / `state_mut` recovery
  replaced the regime, typically **without moving the committed end**; calling that a stall would
  reject a parse the fresh regime can finish. `Rewound` — a rollback landed *below* the capture, so
  the capture describes a position the input has left and supports no claim about the one it is at.
  `Progressed` — the parse committed past the capture. Testing "did not advance" instead of
  "equals" folded both of the first two into `Stalled`; the enum is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so the
  arms are additive.

  **A `State` cannot be compared** — it is bounded `Debug + Clone` — so the crate now names one:
  `Input::regime`, an **id** stamped by `install_rekey`, the sole state-surgery site, and
  **checkpointed** so a restore puts a regime's name back with the regime. Three things make the
  standing-in exact, and each is load-bearing:

  - **the writers are three, and one names the regime.** A commit moves the committed offset, a
    restore carries its own saved id, a surgery allocates a new one — so *equal id ∧ equal offset ⇒
    equal `State`*. The destructuring census in `input::lineage` keeps that trichotomy from silently
    gaining a fourth member;
  - **there is no public path to the live `State`.** A census of assignment *sites* is a claim about
    writes where the conclusion needed is about **values**, and the two coincide only for a type that
    cannot be mutated through a shared reference — which `Debug + Clone` does not give. A `State`
    holding a `Cell<Mode>` is valid, and a `&L::State` would let safe code flip it at the same
    offset with no writer involved. **`InputRef::state`, `ParseState::state` and `Checkpoint::state`
    therefore return owned clones** (breaking; see below). What is left is a `Clone` that *shares*
    its interior mutability, which is the determinism clause's own named violation;
  - **the id is allocated, not derived.** A separate monotone source, **outside** the rollback set,
    for the reason the checkpoint-id source is: deriving the next id from the checkpointed cell is
    not injective, and the counterexample is public — save at `g`, install B (`g+1`), roll back,
    install C (`g+1`), two regimes wearing one name. At `REGIME_EXHAUSTED` the allocator stops and
    that id is **excluded from equality**, so exhaustion forces `ReKeyed` rather than a false
    `Stalled`. An earlier draft saturated an ordinary value and documented the harmless direction;
    the harmful one was what it did.

  **`Stalled` cannot be permanent.** It clears when either input it tests moves: a commit past the
  capture (`Progressed`) or a regime replacement (`ReKeyed`). Measured:
  `a_recovery_answering_the_stall_makes_progress_and_the_next_attempt_says_so` sees `[Stalled]` —
  one turn, not one per turn — and reads the whole document.

  **The capture is affine, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy.** `ScannerAttempt` is not
  `Clone` and `scanner_outcome` consumes it, because a reusable capture recreates the retry the arm
  exists to close: hoist one out of the loop — the natural thing to write — and once any turn
  retains progress past its `at`, every later rolled-back turn still compares *greater* than that
  stale offset and reads `Progressed`. Three doctests pin it: the one-capture control compiles, and
  spending one twice or cloning it does not. It is also why the pair is two types —
  `ScannerTripBaseline` must stay `Copy` for the drivers that read a baseline more than once per
  element loop, and because the split already existed for the `L::Offset`, making the attempt half
  one-shot costs the driver half nothing.

  **`InputRef::judge_scanner`** is the shape a root loop should reach for: it takes the capture,
  runs the closure and returns `(ScannerOutcome, T)`, binding capture, judged work and verdict into
  one turn, so neither placement exists to get wrong. The pair stays public as the lower-level
  surface; affinity is what stops it being misused, and a capture held across turns and spent late
  costs one stale verdict rather than a loop.

  The capture holds `ScannerTripBaseline` rather than restating it, so the nonce and the `'closure`
  brand carry over; it adds `span().end()`, **committed consumption**, never a cache-front reading —
  a lookahead fill moves that reading across skipped trivia without committing, and a guard counting
  it would report a stalled attempt as `Progressed`. That is the drivers' own rule, pinned here by
  `PROGRESS_CENSUS` (`the_scanner_attempt_capture_reads_committed_consumption`), a **source** census
  because every door that clears the latch also empties the cache, so the two accessors coincide at
  every position a behavioural cell can reach. Its unit is per **attempt** where
  `scanner_trip_snapshot` is per collection, and the two stay separate types because a driver reads
  its baseline more than once per element loop and an `L::Offset` would cost it `Copy`.

  **It makes the futile retry detectable; it does not make the work bounded.** That is a placement
  question and `TokenBudget` on the input is the answer, because no rollback reaches it. The two
  compose, and a root loop facing hostile input wants both. Requiring the budget *in the type* is not
  representable today — `ParserContext::with_token_budget` returns `Self`, so a budgeted context is
  not a distinct type — and making it so would change every context construction.

  **Costs** a nonce comparison and a `u64` comparison; then, only when those say a trip happened, a
  `bool` load, an `Option::is_some` and one `Offset::Ord`. The capture costs one `L::Offset::clone`.
  No scan, no lookahead fill, no state clone.

- **`ErrorContainer::clear`.** `Errors` is now the only door onto its container (#247), so it has
  to serve the removals that door used to reach through `DerefMut`. The method is defaulted
  through `pop`, so an existing implementation keeps compiling unchanged; the four built-in
  containers override it with their own.

- **`ErrorContainer::from_errors` — the bulk-construction hook `FromIterator` cannot be** (#284).
  `Errors::from_iter` has to know what its container refused, and `FromIterator` has no channel for
  saying. This one returns `(Self, bool)`: the container, and whether it declined any of the errors
  it was offered. It is **defaulted to the per-item `try_push` funnel**, so a container that ignores
  it accounts exactly as it did and no existing implementation changes; `Vec` and `VecDeque`
  override it with their own `FromIterator` and answer `false`, which is sound because neither can
  refuse an error — not because the standard library specialises the fill underneath.

  It is trusted no further than `try_push` already is. A container that keeps only what fits and
  answers `false` makes `Errors::overflowed()` report clean over dropped errors, which is precisely
  what a `try_push` answering `Ok(())` after dropping one has always been able to do. Same door on
  the same caller-implemented trait, one call wider.

- **`InputRef::peek_map` — a windowed read whose return type can express a terminal stop.** The
  terminal-aware reads this crate shipped were all **head-only**: `peek_kind`, `head_satisfies` and
  `peek_head_map` raise on a resource-limit trip or a latched poison boundary and reserve
  `Ok(None)` for a genuine end of input. A production needing *two* tokens of lookahead had only
  `peek::<W>`, which answers a terminal stop with `Ok` holding a shorter window — the same value a
  genuinely short input produces, and there is nothing in it to tell them apart.

  **The gap was the return type, not the documentation.** `peek`'s Partial-mode section already
  recorded that a limit trip "emits its diagnostic and latches the poison boundary before the
  holdback is consulted, so a peek can no more hide a tripped limit than a consume can" — true of
  the diagnostic, and never a claim about the value. With a **fatal** emitter the difference is
  invisible, because the trip's diagnostic ends the parse either way; with a **non-fatal** emitter
  that accepts it, the caller is handed `Ok` with fewer tokens than it asked for and reads that as
  a grammar fact. A production distinguishing `other + fill` from `other + fill(0) x` on the second
  token gets a silently different parse rather than an error.

  `peek_map::<W, _, _>(f)` is `peek_head_map`'s treatment at an arbitrary width: `f` sees the
  filled window and its value is returned; a window short because the input genuinely ended, or
  because a `Partial` frontier withheld the rest, is handed to `f` like any other and is `Ok`; a
  window cut short by a terminal stop raises the terminal end-of-input error and `f` does not run.
  It rides the existing `peek_with_emitter_terminal` fill, so it reserves the same one owned window
  and panics on the same broken-`Cache` condition.

  One contract difference from `peek_head_map` is deliberate: there `Ok(None)` is the genuine end
  of input and `f` does not run, while here `f` runs on the window whatever its length. A head read
  has two lengths and can lift the empty one out; a `W`-wide window has `W + 1`, and folding every
  short one into a single `None` would discard the tokens that *are* there. The `Option` belongs to
  the caller's projection — `peek_map::<U2, _, _>(|w| w.iter().nth(1).map(|t| t.token().kind()))` —
  and `peek_map::<W, _, _>(|w| w)` recovers the unmapped read with the stop moved into the error
  arm.

  **`peek::<W>` is unchanged.** It is public, its Partial-mode contract is documented and tested,
  and a caller relying on the short window is not wrong. Its documentation now draws the conclusion
  that section stopped one step short of — the diagnostic is not hidden, the return value cannot
  distinguish, and `peek_with_emitter_terminal` or `peek_map` is what can.

- **`stacker` — an optional, `std`-only segmented native stack for the two Pratt frame
  prologues.** Each pratt frame now asks how much native stack is left and, when it is inside a
  256 KiB red zone, runs on a fresh 2 MiB heap segment. The check sits on the same line
  `InputRef::descend` already occupies, **composed with it and never substituted for it**, so a
  recursion site added later inherits it for free. Off by default, and `std`-only because stacker
  reads the running thread's stack bounds through pthread or Win32 — so it is off in every no-std
  leg and the `thumbv6m-none-eabi` matrix never names it. **It implies `pratt`**, because
  `mod native_stack` is `pratt`-gated and the two prologues are its only callers; without that,
  `--features stacker` resolved the dependency and built `psm`'s `cc` script for a build that
  compiled nothing able to call it.

  **It does not move the shared default, and that is deliberate.**
  `RecursionLimiter::PARSE_DEFAULT_DEPTH` seeds every `InputContext`, and that cell is what
  hand-written public descent — `InputRef::descend` / `descending`, from a consumer's own
  productions — draws on. Those frames are ordinary unsegmented frames on an ordinary thread stack,
  so a feature that segments *tokora's* Pratt frames justifies no change to their budget: 1024 of
  them at the heaviest measured per-level cost is ~41 MiB against a 2 MiB thread, which is the
  abort the whole recursion story exists to delete. The figure the feature does justify is
  published separately as **`RecursionLimiter::SEGMENTED_PRATT_DEPTH`** (1024, `stacker`-only), for
  a caller whose whole descent is Pratt frames to pass to `with_recursion_limiter` — opt-in,
  because only the caller knows whether that precondition holds of their grammar.

  **It does not make depth unlimited, and the recursion limiter stays.** What changes is that for
  a segmented frame the ceiling stops being a hardware constant and becomes a number someone
  chose. A segment is a
  heap allocation, and stacker's allocator is `mmap` plus an assertion rather than a fallible
  reserve, so a deep enough input still ends the process with nothing on any `Result` channel.
  Measured, feature on and limiter set to `unlimited()`: a prefix chain returns `Ok` at 1 000 000
  levels — 258× what a *release* build fits on a 2 MiB thread — using 5 588 MB and climbing
  linearly at ~5.7 KiB per level, with no refusal at any depth. The sweep was ended by a ceiling
  imposed from outside the process, because nothing inside it ends. The two real terminations are a
  kernel kill and stacker's own `mmap failed to allocate stack` panic (exit 101, or exit 134 under
  `panic = "abort"`), and neither is a value a caller can match on. **So the budget is what makes
  deep input refusable, and this feature is not a substitute for it.** The derivations, both
  tables and the run are in `src/native_stack.rs`.

- **`RecursionLimiter::PARSE_DEFAULT_DEPTH` is public.** It was `pub(crate)`, so a caller could set
  a budget through `InputContext::with_recursion_limiter` but could not name the default in order
  to reason about it. Most depths in `pratt_limit.rs` and `pratt_recovery.rs` are now read off it
  rather than written out — though deliberately not all of them, since a suite that derives every
  expectation from its subject moves its own boundary when the subject moves. The literal figures
  live in `src/state/recursion_tracker/tests.rs`, one cell per configuration.

  It is also keyed on the build profile now, and both cells currently read 16. Every measurement
  behind it is a debug one, and a release frame is up to 31x cheaper, so a release build will
  eventually carry a larger figure; it does not yet, because the five-axis consumer bisection has
  not been run against a release build and extrapolating it from debug's ratio would be the same
  derived-from-the-wrong-population mistake the constant was just repaired for. The release cell is
  a floor equal to the debug one, held there by a `const` assertion that names what would lift it.

- **`cst::parse_lossless_with_context` and `cst::parse_lossless_partial_with_context`** — the
  lossless drivers with the parse's `InputContext`, and therefore its `RecursionLimiter`, supplied
  by the caller. The existing pair built their own context, so a lossless parse could choose its
  emitter and cache but not its recursion budget, and `Cst::from_sink` / `Sink::finish` /
  `Input::into_emitter` are all crate-private, so the plumbing could not be hand-rolled either.
  Additive: `parse_lossless` and `parse_lossless_partial` are now one-line delegations to the new
  pair, so existing calls compile untouched and the four doors cannot drift.

  The context carries the **inner** emitter, not the sink. The sink is still minted by the driver
  from `src`, and `Sink::new` stays crate-private, so the module's invariant — the buffer the
  tree's text is sliced from and the buffer the parse reads are the same argument of the same call
  — holds for all four doors.

- **`CacheHarness::lex_attempts_multiple` — an override for the corpus builder's anti-hang
  ceiling.** The default of 8 attempts per source unit plus a floor of 64 was presented as a
  consequence of the lexer contract, and it is not one: the contract asks for *non-decreasing*
  starts and *individually* nonempty spans, which permits overlapping and repeated-start items, so
  a deterministic, finite, terminating lexer may emit many items per source unit. The cache kit
  does not enforce even that much — it drives the raw lexer and never runs the lexer-contract tier
  — so the number was an assumption wearing a derivation's clothes.

  The consequence was a false *failure*: a lexer that terminates but emits densely was refused as
  non-terminating, and with no override on the harness the certification could not be run at all.
  Failing in the safe direction is not the same as being right. The multiple is now the caller's
  and the refusal names it. It is spelled `lex_attempts_multiple` rather than `budget_multiple`
  because it scales a different quantity than `Harness::budget_multiple` does: attempts the corpus
  builder may make, not items a run may produce. `0` is treated as `1`, as on the lexer harness.

- **`input::TokenBudget` — a durable, driver-enforced ceiling on the items a lexer may produce**
  (#285), configured through `InputContext::with_token_budget` and
  `ParserContext::with_token_budget`, read back through `InputRef::token_budget`. **Default
  unlimited**, so nothing changes for a parse that does not ask for one.

  The counter this crate already shipped, `TokenLimiter`, lives inside `L::State` — which is a
  `Checkpoint` field. A rollback therefore reinstalls the saved tally and gives the count back, and
  the two public state-surgery doors (`InputRef::set_state` and `InputRef::state_mut`, documented
  as the limit-recovery path) replace it outright. That is the *correct* semantics for a bound on
  tokens in the committed stream, and the whole terminal-trip pipeline is built on it, so it is
  unchanged. It is the wrong semantics for a bound on work performed: an attempt that lexed a
  thousand items and then declined performed a thousand items of scanning, and a counter that
  forgets them bounds nothing against a grammar an adversary can make speculate. The new cell lives
  on the `Input`, beside `recursion`, outside the rollback set, with **no mutator** — there is no
  `Input::token_budget_mut` and no `InputRef::token_budget_mut`, the same absence `recursion` and
  `emitter` rely on.

  **The unit is the item produced, not the item accepted**, and the difference is the reason the
  ceiling exists. A plain lexer error leaves `Lexer::check` `Ok`, so the scanner reports it and goes
  on looking for the next valid token: one valid token followed by *N* bytes of garbage is **one
  accepted token** while *N* scans run and *N* diagnostics accumulate durably in the emitter's log.
  Measured over *N* in {64, 128, 512, 2048}, the accept count stayed `1` while scans ran
  {66, 130, 514, 2050} and diagnostics {64, 128, 512, 2048} — so a ceiling denominated in accepts
  is satisfied by all four. Trivia is charged; a peek-fill is charged at production, not at
  consumption; a cached token replayed after a rollback is not charged again, because nothing
  lexes.

  **The ceiling is tested in front of the lexer, not behind it**, at the single lexing site both
  drivers pass through — which makes "no item was produced without authorization" and "every item
  produced was charged" properties of the module rather than rules each driver remembers. A durable
  counter is only half a bound. Asked *after* the work, the refusal has to be recorded in the
  poison boundary for a caller to see it, and the boundary is a lineage memo: a rollback restores
  it, and `set_state`/`state_mut` drop it. The spend would then be durable while the *enforcement*
  was refundable, so a public `attempt` that drains to the refusal and declines re-enters against
  an unchanged `spent` and the lexer runs again — once per call, without bound. Measured: a budget
  of **zero** funded one full `Lexer::lex` per re-entry (4, 16, 256 rounds → 4, 16, 256
  invocations, `spent` still `0`), identically by all three routes; with the preflight it funds a
  flat **one**, whatever the round count and by whichever of the four doors. The exhausted `B = 4`
  case ran `B + rounds` scans and now runs `B + 1`.

  **A met ceiling is not an end of input**, and the gate cannot answer that question on its own —
  it knows what `spent` is, not whether another item exists. Answering the first as though it were
  the second reports a *fully parsed* document as a terminal stop, which a terminal-aware consumer
  rejects and a `PartialSession` latches on permanently; it fires at exactly the calibration a
  budget is most likely to be given, `N` for a document of `N` items. So the site settles it in two
  steps. The end of the source, positionally, costs nothing and covers a zero budget over an empty
  source and every document whose last item ends at its last byte. The residue is a tail the lexer
  *skips* — after the last token of `"aa  "` the lex position is `2` against a length of `4`, the
  shape of every lexer that discards trailing whitespace — and only running the lexer can settle
  that, so it is run **once** per `Input` and the outcome is latched in the budget beside `spent`,
  where no rollback, no state re-key and no rewinding `sync` can reach it. That one call is the
  whole cost of the repair: a bounded drain is now `items + 1` scans, which is the same shape the
  *unbounded* drain has always had — items plus one exhausting probe. A probe that found no item
  latches nothing and stays re-derivable, at exactly what asking an unbudgeted input the same
  question costs.

  **Exhaustion is terminal**, and it had to be: a `PartialSession` rebuilds a fresh `Input` — and
  therefore a fresh budget — for every redrive, so a refusal read as an ordinary failure would
  re-drive forever. The refusal latches the poison boundary and counts a scanner trip through the
  same writer a lexer-side limit trip goes through, so `next` folds it into `Ok(None)`,
  `next_or_stop` and the `*_or_stop` family surface the end-of-input error already marked terminal,
  the recovery gates re-raise, and a session latches. What it cannot do is *report* itself: a
  diagnostic would have to be built as the emitter's own error type, which no consume path is
  bounded to construct, so the refused item is refused silently — including a lexer error on
  exactly that item, which the one-shot probe drops where it stands.

  **`unlimited()` is the absence of a ceiling, not `usize::MAX` of one.** `is_exhausted` excludes
  the sentinel explicitly, because `spent >= max` made the one budget that promised to refuse
  nothing begin refusing everything, terminally, once `spent` reached `usize::MAX`. That distance
  is unreachable at a 64-bit `usize` and is `4_294_967_295` produce-events at 32 bits — and this
  ceiling charges a *re-lex* as a produce-event, so it is a distance one long-lived `Input` over a
  speculating grammar can cover without a four-billion-token document. `with_limitation(usize::MAX)`
  is the same value and therefore the same behaviour. The charge saturates, since excluding the
  sentinel from the gate is exactly what lets `spend` be reached at `spent == usize::MAX`, where a
  bare increment would wrap the counter back to zero.

  What it does **not** bound is stated at the type: not distinct document tokens (a region the
  cache could not retain across a rollback is re-lexed, and re-lexing charges again — the direction
  the input module's own docs already warn about, "counts replay as input and trips on valid
  documents"), not the cost of an item, and not a session. Calibrate against produce-events.

- **`InputRef::trip_snapshot` / `tripped_during_attempt` are public, and the baseline is an opaque
  `input::ResourceTripBaseline`.** They were `pub(crate)`, so a **descent** budget trip was
  answerable outside this crate only through carriers the grammar supplies — `MaybeTerminal` on an
  error type whose `From` may discard the trip, and a latch a `Checkpoint` refunds — which are the
  two carriers this counter was added because they cannot be trusted. The bodies and every in-crate
  call site are unchanged; what moved is the visibility and the baseline's type.

  **The consumer, and what not having them cost it.** al8n/smear#169. A hand-written document-root
  loop catches a failed definition and decides whether that failure ends the document; deciding by
  reading the error, a nesting refusal reached the loop looking ordinary, the loop resynchronised
  and re-read the abandoned nest at document level, and one refusal became one diagnostic per
  remaining unit — 67 at 66 levels, 804 at 800, growing with the document. This crate does not
  publish API on speculation and these sat crate-private for that reason; a real consumer with a
  real defect is the argument that was missing.

  **The scanner twin stays crate-internal, and that is a measurement rather than a scoping
  choice.** `scanner_trip_snapshot` / `scanner_tripped_during_attempt` were published in the same
  change and withdrawn before release. `set_state` and `state_mut` re-key the input's
  forward-scanning facts, and dropping the poison boundary there is the crate's **documented**
  limit-recovery path, while that counter is monotone and never cleared — so a loop doing exactly
  what the witness's own documentation prescribes can trip, recover, read the whole document, reach
  a genuine end of input, and still be told it was truncated. Measured: eight tokens under a scan
  budget of three, recovered with `set_state`, consumed all eight with the witness still answering
  `true`. That is correct use under two conflicting public contracts, and reconciling them is a
  change to this crate's terminal law that all twelve collection drivers, the recovery gate and
  `skip_then_retry` would inherit — a design round, not a visibility change.

  On the **declining** exits a consumer has `InputRef::try_expect_or_stop`, whose contract is that
  a terminal stop is an error and never a decline; it reads the live boundary, so the same recovery
  that leaves the counter poisoned correctly stops it reporting a stop. All three of those
  positions are measured in `tokora/tests/root_loop_trip_witness.rs`.

  **It is not a replacement for the withdrawn pair, and this changelog said so earlier in terms
  that were too strong.** A *rejecting* (fail-fast) emitter reports a lexer-resource trip by
  returning the value its `From<<L::Token as Token>::Error>` builds, and `scan_with(..)?`
  propagates it from **inside** `try_expect_or_stop`, before that call can raise a terminal stop.
  The caller receives an ordinary grammar error over an exhausted scanner, and no delegation in its
  `MaybeTerminal` can repair it, because nothing on the path is marked to delegate to — the same
  fact `scanner_tripped_during_attempt` documents from the other side when it says it answers where
  the error value cannot. That exit is answered by `InputRef::at_scanner_stop`, in the entry above;
  it is not answered by publishing the withdrawn pair, and that entry says why.

  **The descent pair has no such exposure**, and the reason is the channel rather than luck: a
  descent refusal is *returned* by `InputRef::descend` and never routed through an emitter, so no
  emitter can unmark it or convert it away from the counter that already recorded it.
  `the_descent_witness_holds_under_a_rejecting_emitter` runs the amplification loop under a
  fail-fast emitter and gets one refusal, one stop, nothing filed.

  Its **scanner** counterpart is `InputRef::at_scanner_stop`, in the entry above. It is not this
  pair's twin made public — it is a different reading, and that is what closed the gap.

  **The baseline is a type, not a `usize`.** `ResourceTripBaseline` is opaque — no accessor, no
  `PartialEq`, no constructor, and a hand-written `Debug` that renders `ResourceTripBaseline(..)`
  and nothing else. A derive would have handed the absolute count straight back through `{:?}` in
  one line, along with the nonce, which is the address of an internal slot; a cell asserts the
  render carries no ASCII digit at all, and restoring the derive reddens it. `Copy` is deliberate:
  a driver hands the same baseline to two gates in one loop turn, and duplicating one is harmless
  because storage is refused by the region parameter rather than by move semantics. The scanner
  baseline's own type makes the two impossible to swap at the sites that take both.

  **A foreign baseline is refused by the type on every public path, and panics where it is not.**
  Which mechanism does what was pinned by planting against each, because the plausible story is
  wrong twice. The `'closure` **parameter** is the whole of the refusal: a baseline cannot be
  stashed where it outlives the invocation, and it cannot be captured by a closure that must
  satisfy the `for<'c>` bound a nested parse imposes — which is the realistic cross-wire, a driver
  holding two inputs alive and judging the inner with the outer's baseline. Both are `compile_fail`
  doctests — a `Cell` stash, a closure capture, and a hand-written `ParseInput` impl carrying one
  in a field — each paired with a control that carries a region-free `usize` in the same position
  and compiles. Since `Input` is crate-internal, no consumer can hold two handles whose regions
  unify at all.

  **The brand's invariance is load-bearing, at an identified site.** This sentence was wrong twice
  before landing here, so it is stated as the measurement: flipping the brand to a bare reference
  changes these five shapes as follows.

  | shape | invariant | covariant |
  |---|---|---|
  | a bare region-shrinking coercion on the type | refused | **accepted** |
  | a generic adapter: `&mut InputRef<'short>` plus a baseline `<'long>`, `'long: 'short` | refused | **accepted** |
  | a `Cell` stash | refused | refused |
  | a closure capture under a `for<'c>` bound | refused | refused |
  | a hand-written `ParseInput` impl carrying one in a field | refused | refused |

  **The adapter row is the one that decides it**, and it is a *consumption* site — the case an
  earlier draft of this entry claimed could not exist when it concluded the brand was redundant
  with `InputRef`'s own invariance in `'closure`. In the last three rows the handle is itself
  coerced or universally quantified, so its invariance refuses first and the brand's cannot be
  seen. In the adapter the handle sits at one fixed region and is never coerced; only the baseline
  moves, and the brand is then the only thing refusing. Under a covariant brand that call compiles
  and is publicly reachable — carry an outer baseline through an inner parse's context and the
  nested parse cross-feeds a foreign baseline into the nonce panic. **Do not weaken the brand.**

  Three probes agreed it was inert and all three shared a shape. Agreement between probes that
  share a shape is not independent evidence.

  **Both trip counters are `u64` and saturate, and the verdicts are exact everywhere a program can
  reach.** Two defects, and the second was created by the repair for the first. Wrapping aliased:
  at `usize` width, 2^32 trips return to a baseline exactly on a 32-bit target and the verdict
  answered `false` over an attempt in which every `descend` refused — a loop rather than a
  lifetime, since a zero recursion limit makes every `descend` a trip. Saturating at `usize::MAX`
  with an unconditional "exhausted means tripped" disjunct fixed that and introduced the mirror: at
  the ceiling the disjunct fires whether or not anything tripped, so an attempt that descended
  **nothing** read terminal, permanently, for the rest of the session. Wrapping failed open once;
  saturation failed closed forever.

  The **width** is what resolves it, not the verdict. At `u64` the point a 32-bit loop can drive
  the counters to — `u32::MAX`, four billion refusals — is nowhere near a ceiling of 2^64, and the
  reading there is exact in both directions.

  **Two ceilings now, and they are different things.** `u64::MAX` is where the counter gives up,
  the verdicts fail closed, and no program reaches. `usize::MAX` is a **display clamp** on
  `Cst::resource_trips`, which returns `usize` — reachable on a 32-bit target, a floor when it
  fires, and *not* an exhaustion point: the counter keeps counting and attempt-relative readings
  stay exact past it. `Cst`'s `Debug` renders the underlying value and marks it with a trailing `+`
  only at the real ceiling, since that was the second public reading of the count and only the
  accessor had been qualified.

  **The 32-bit cost is measured, and accepted — with the layout in it, and scoped.** `trip_snapshot`
  is taken per *element*, so it is on the hot path of every successful element.
  `tripped_during_attempt` is not, and **it has no single frequency**: how often it runs is a
  property of the termination class, and ranges from neither verdict to both. Three earlier versions
  of this entry each asserted one number, read off whichever call sites the author had looked at,
  and each was wrong in a different way. The model is therefore derived from all five sites in the
  crate that evaluate either verdict and kept in **one** place —
  `InputRef::tripped_during_attempt` — and this entry deliberately does not reproduce it, because
  the same sentence living in several places is the defect that produced those three versions.

  `thumbv6m-none-eabi` at `-O`:

  | | `usize` | `u64` | delta | runs |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `trip_snapshot` | 5 instr | 7 instr | +2 | per element |
  | `tripped_during_attempt` | 17 instr | 22 instr | +5 | 0-2 per collection termination, by class |
  | element loop (N + 1) | 31 instr | 38 instr | +7 | per collection |
  | that loop's stack frame | 16 B | 24 B | +8 B | per collection |
  | `ResourceTripBaseline` | 8 B, align 4 | 16 B, align 8 | ×2 | carried per element |

  The layout row is what an instruction count does not show — the baseline is `Copy` and passed by
  value — and it is here because it was missing the first time this was priced.

  Whole-parse on `wasm32-wasip1`, the widest 32-bit target executable on this host (`i686` cannot
  link here): a collection-parse binary grew **33 bytes** (120,421 → 120,454, +0.027%), and
  interleaved executed latency showed **no regression** — one long collection at `-5.8%` min /
  `-5.3%` median, many short collections at `-0.35%` / `-7.25%`, n=12 each. Both land at or below
  zero, which is an instrument that cannot resolve the change rather than a speedup.

  **What that measurement covers, stated rather than generalised.** The probe is a non-delimited
  collection terminating by **decline** — one class of six; the classes and what each evaluates are
  in the canonical table on `InputRef::tripped_during_attempt`. Four of the five it does not
  exercise are **cheaper or equal** per termination. The fifth is **not**, and it is the one this
  entry has to name on its own rather than defer: a `skip_then_retry` workload pays both verdicts
  per *successful* sync or advance step, and that shape is **unmeasured**.

  Accepted on that scope: two instructions and eight stack bytes per element loop, against an
  element that has already run a cache probe or a full lex and commit. Keeping `count` at `usize`
  and moving the exhaustion distinction to a second cell would buy back four bytes and add a load at
  the same sites, and the executed measurement gives it nothing to recover.

  **The residual is stated rather than hidden**: past 2^64 refusals in one input session the count
  cannot record another, the two questions become one value, and the verdict fails closed. That
  state is unreachable and is pinned as a labelled residual rather than as a passing grade.

  Four cells, each with its own discriminating plant, and the quiet-attempt one is written from the
  side the repair is not — every earlier ceiling cell took its baseline and then drove real trips,
  which is precisely why none of them could see a verdict that had become permanently `true`.

  What no type can decide is **placement**, and that is the misuse that survives: the descent
  baseline belongs inside the element loop and the scanner one above it, and each taken at the
  other's unit is a measured defect. Both directions are now behavioural cells rather than prose —
  the hoisted descent baseline in `tokora/tests/root_loop_trip_witness.rs`, the per-element scanner
  baseline in `input::input_ref::tests`.

- **`conformance::Harness::run_refill` — the tier for state that has to survive a change of
  buffer** (#292). `run_partial` drives every prefix with a **fresh** lexer, so no `L::State` ever
  crosses a cut, and `run`'s state-resume check carries a state but resumes it over the **same**
  source. Neither is what a refilling driver does — carry `(State, offset)` from the end of one
  buffer into a **grown** buffer and continue — and that is the mode `Incomplete` exists for. The
  distinction is not *does state survive* but ***does state survive a change of buffer***.

  **What lived in that gap.** al8n/pql#39: a LogQL lexer that, on a nonempty `#` comment reaching
  end of input, advanced to `bytes.len()` and retained only its lookahead offset, losing that the
  scanner was still inside the comment. Lex `x #c`, carry the state into `x #c\n0b1`, resume, and
  the guarded `0b` arm fails on the stale reader: `Err(MalformedNumber)` where lexing the whole
  source yields a number. Carry it into `x #cd` instead and the resume emits an identifier out of
  bytes the complete parse reads as comment text. Present from that module's first commit, through
  several rounds of adversarial review, with the kit green throughout — and the silence was
  verified rather than inferred, with both sources in the harness corpus and a direct probe
  failing beside it.

  **A new entry point rather than an assertion inside one, for three reasons and each is somebody's
  cost.** An `Input` is constructed at offset `0` and derives its own resume pair, so nothing can
  hand the layer a carried state — which is what the consumer reported when it tried, and why the
  tier drives the `Lexer` surface (`with_state` + `bump`) directly. `check_resume`'s signature is
  one `src` and its loop runs over that source's own reference items. And `run` deliberately asks
  nothing of the offset type or the source, so folding this in would narrow `run` for every lexer
  that cannot reach the defect; the tier sits beside `run_partial` and asks for less than it does —
  `Offset = usize` and the two equalities, and **not** a prefix-sliceable source, because making a
  buffer is the driver's obligation and the bound lives on the drivers that need it.

  **What it drives.** For every cut of every input — every position the source can be sliced at and
  the driver can end a chunk at, so a cut inside a token, at a token boundary, inside trivia, at
  end of input and at zero are covered by construction rather than by a list — it runs four
  schedule shapes: one refill delivering the whole tail, a refill that **adds nothing**, a minimal
  one-cut refill and then the rest, and the tail one chunk at a time from the first admitted buffer
  up. A leg commits only what a partial `Input`
  would (an item whose effective read frontier reaches the non-final buffer end is withheld), and
  where nothing is withheld and the lexer runs out of bytes it carries the lexer's own
  post-exhaustion position and the state there — the offset the frontier reports, covering the
  bytes a lexer *skips* without emitting an item. The committed items across the whole schedule
  must equal the complete-input lex, exactly.

  **The buffers are the caller's, and so is the cut rule — as one answer.** `run_refill` takes a
  required `conformance::RefillDriver`, whose single method returns the buffer that driver holds
  once `k` units have arrived, or `None` when no chunk of its can end at `k`. Two shipped
  implementations: `OwnedChunks` copies every admitted prefix into storage of its own, so a leg
  really does change allocation, and `SameAllocation` hands back `&src[..k]`, which changes the
  buffer's *length* over one base address. The kit cannot supply either itself — `L::Source` is
  `?Sized`, so it cannot own one, and a leg's items borrow their slices for the corpus lifetime, so
  a per-leg allocation could not outlive the leg — which is the same wall the tier exists because
  of: the caller owns the buffer and grows it.

  Both halves of that answer are load-bearing, and both have cells. **Backing:** a lexer whose
  `State` carries anything derived from *where* the bytes are — a raw pointer, an interner keyed by
  address, a cached slice — passes under `SameAllocation` and reds under `OwnedChunks`, same lexer,
  same corpus, same cuts; without a real change of buffer the tier's own subject sentence was
  untested. **Cut rule:** `Source::is_boundary` for `[u8]` is every byte index, including one
  inside a UTF-8 code point, and a byte lexer written for a driver that validates what it appends
  was convicted on a schedule its driver cannot produce — #295's failure mode at the level of which
  inputs are legitimate at all. Which is why they are one method: the thing that produces chunks is
  the thing that knows where a chunk may end, and a buffer for a cut a driver cannot reach is a
  buffer it would never hold.

  **A cut rule is an exemption, and the kit narrows it as far as it can and no further.** The rule
  sees only `(src, k)` and never the lexer; it is asked only where `is_boundary` already said yes,
  so a driver narrows and never widens; it is asked once per cut, so a drifting answer cannot put
  two buffers into one comparison; a buffer that is not a content-preserving prefix is refused
  (`refill-buffer`), and a driver that admits no cut below the source length is refused as having
  certified nothing (`refill-coverage`). Both refusals are worded as the kit declining a verdict
  rather than as the lexer failing one. What no kit can do is tell a driver's real chunk rule from
  a convenient one — so `SameAllocation` is a value you write, for `Budget`'s reason, and the run
  returns a `conformance::RefillCoverage`: cuts exercised, cuts the sources offered, and cuts whose
  buffer actually relocated. A narrow rule is then a number rather than a silence.

  **A certificate nobody reads is the silence it replaced**, so `run_refill` and `RefillCoverage`
  are both `#[must_use]`: `harness.run_refill(driver);` drops the numbers at the semicolon, and a
  driver that admitted one cut of five then reads exactly like one that admitted all five. The two
  requirements a caller actually has are one call each —
  `RefillCoverage::require_every_admissible_cut` and `RefillCoverage::require_every_cut_relocated`
  — returning `&Self` so that requiring both is one chain and the chain is a statement rather than
  another value to drop. The second is `SameAllocation`'s stated reduction as a failed requirement
  rather than as a paragraph, and it reports the requirement **unanswerable** rather than unmet
  over a source whose `Source::REFERENT_IS_BYTES` is `false`, where no address comparison proves
  anything.

  **Every supplied buffer is validated four times, and the count is not the point — the moments
  are.** Once as it arrives and once after the driver has answered every cut of that input: being
  asked once stops a driver giving a second *answer* and does not stop it writing through the
  reference it already gave — a `Cell`, a `RefCell`, an arena it reuses — while the schedules are
  built out of the whole table at once. A buffer that passed at cut 3 and was rewritten while cut 4
  was being answered was lexed in its rewritten form, and the divergence that followed was reported
  against the lexer.

  The settled pass closes the window the driver's own **callbacks** open, and nothing else — which
  is the correction to what that paragraph used to claim, that the pass established every prefix at
  the same time. It does not: the pass itself runs caller code at every step (`Source::as_slice`,
  the slice type's `PartialEq`, and the destructor of the value it drops *after* a successful
  comparison), and the schedules then lex those same references through more of it. So the table is
  asked again at the two moments where a stale buffer costs something: **before any divergence is
  blamed on the lexer**, so a buffer that changed wins the diagnosis and the refusal is the
  driver's; and **after the last schedule has run**, because a rewrite that produced no divergence
  would otherwise leave a green earned over bytes the oracle never lexed, and that is the one
  outcome no later comparison can take back. Both are the same one comparison with a different
  sentence, and the first runs only on a path that is about to panic. The residue — a buffer
  rewritten and put back between two checks — is stated as a requirement on the driver instead:
  the bytes behind a buffer you hand back do not change for the duration of the run.

  **What the kit cannot check is stated as an obligation rather than hooked.** That validation
  compares `Source::Slice` values while the lexer receives the whole `L::Source`, and slice
  equality is not source equivalence: a source carrying a mode, a keyword table or a dialect its
  slice does not show can be handed back with the right text in the wrong mode, pass, and have the
  resulting divergence charged to a conforming lexer. So the tier assumes **a source whose lexical
  semantics are fully represented by its `Slice`**, in the posture the reflexivity obligation
  already has. Not a caller-supplied predicate, because that is a caller-supplied exemption and the
  cut rule is the one such channel this design admits — a second would have the kit asking the
  driver to certify the driver. Not a bound either: the equality that would settle it needs
  `Index<RangeTo<usize>, Output = Self>`, the bound this tier dropped in order to reach a source
  that cannot slice itself, and a marker trait is this obligation with a compile step in front of
  it.

  **The obligation binds a hand-written driver, and the shipped ones are held to something the kit
  can keep.** A `RefillDriver` somebody writes has an author for the obligation to bind. A driver
  the kit ships does not: the caller of `run_refill(SameAllocation)` never wrote the code that
  derives the buffer, and `Index<RangeTo<usize>, Output = S>` — everything that driver used to ask
  for — proves nothing about meaning. A source of `{ text, keywords }` may legally index to stored
  prefixes under the other flag, every buffer validates as an equal slice, and the leg then commits
  an `Ident` where the oracle has a `Keyword`: a lexer-blaming `refill-equivalence` red out of a
  driver the kit hands out. So `SameAllocation` and `OwnedChunks` now require
  `conformance::SemanticPrefix` — *this source's prefix by indexing is the prefix, and its round
  trip through `ToOwned` and back preserves that too* — which is **sealed**, implemented for `str`,
  `[u8]` and `bstr::BStr`. Sealed because an impl of it is a promise nobody can check, and an
  unsealed marker is the caller-supplied exemption this design already refused; sealed, it says the
  one thing the kit is in a position to say. A slice-invisible source keeps the tier and loses the
  shortcut: it writes the handful of lines of `RefillDriver`, which is where the obligation already
  said the answer lived. Two doctests over the same `Index`-able mode source pin both directions,
  differing in their last statement and in nothing else: `SameAllocation` does not compile, a
  hand-written driver does.

  **A terminal stop is not a refill, so the tier refuses to drive one.** `InputRef::classify` ranks
  the crate's terminal predicate — a failing `Lexer::check` — *ahead* of the partial-input frontier
  holdback: the layer emits the item, latches its poison boundary and never refills, and the
  document ends there. Applying the holdback to every error withheld a terminal one, restored the
  pre-trip pair and re-lexed the tripping bytes on the grown buffer, so a conforming lexer that
  trips over `"ab"` at cut 1 — production terminates at `Err@0..1` — was re-driven to `Err@0..2`,
  matched the complete-input oracle, and **passed a transition production never makes**. A leg now
  asks `check` where the layer asks it and on the arm the layer asks it on (a token is never
  terminal, so the token path calls no `check`), and a schedule reaching one **stops**.

  The promise for such a schedule is **non-certifying**, not *compared differently*, and the two are
  different promises to the caller. Comparing differently needs a second oracle — the complete input
  under the same ranking — and the two runs stop at legitimately different items, because the tally
  a limit trips on is per lexer and a refilling driver builds a fresh lexer per leg, which is the
  very reason the layer latches at the *input* level. That comparison would charge a count
  divergence to the lexer for something that is not a refill defect, and truncating both sides to
  the shorter leaves a comparison whose length the lexer chooses — vacuous exactly where the trip is
  early. So the schedule certifies nothing and the run says so: `RefillCoverage::schedules` and
  `RefillCoverage::non_certifying` carry the ratio, and an input **all** of whose schedules ended
  that way is refused as `refill-terminal`, in `refill-coverage`'s posture and for its reason.

  **The withholding is what keeps it from being stricter than the contract**, and the plant says so
  rather than the sentence: with the holdback removed, every conforming fixture in the tree reds —
  `"ab"` cut out of `"abc"` commits a truncated token and resumes behind the `c`. **The
  post-exhaustion carry is what catches the defect**, and that plant is the sharper one: carry the
  last-committed pair instead and all three witness cells go green while every conforming fixture
  stays green, which is precisely the tier that would have missed pql.

  Nothing about *what counts as equal* is decided here. The items are compared by `Item::compare`
  through `diverge` — the same ranked search `run`, `check_resume` and both partial-tier asserts
  read their verdicts from, with the same `non-reflexive-payload` refusal in front of it (#295,
  #324). A second implementation of that rule would be a second place for it to be wrong.

  Cost is Θ(n²) raw lexing per input, the order `run_partial` and `check_resume` already carry.

### Changed (breaking)

- **The spanned owning destination moves from `Collect<..>` to `With<Collect<..>, PhantomSpan>` on
  all twelve repetition drivers** (#334). It was already spelled that way on the eight separated
  families; the four plain ones — `repeated`, `repeated_while`, and the delimited form of each —
  wrote it as a second `ParseInput` impl on the *same* `Self` as the owning destination, differing
  only in the trait's output parameter.

  **Nothing selects between two such impls when the output is inferred.** A destination is chosen
  by that parameter, so a caller who leaves it open gets `error[E0283]: type annotations needed`
  and no annotation at the call site helps — the ambiguity is in selecting the method, not in
  typing its result. Every `.spanned()`-shaped extension method leaves it open, because the output
  is a parameter of such a trait and never appears in the method's return type; `smear-parser`'s
  `.token_spanned()` is one, and it took 34 of them across two dialects.

  This crate could not see it. An uninstantiated generic instantiates no ambiguity, and the tests
  that exercise these destinations pin the output through an annotated return type, which resolves
  the choice before it is made. Only a downstream caller that leaves it open reaches it.

  Migration is to wrap the collector: `parser.repeated().collect()` parsed to
  `Spanned<Container, L::Span>` becomes
  `With::new(parser.repeated().collect(), PhantomSpan::PHANTOM)`. The owning
  (`Collect<P, Container>` → `Container`) and borrowed (`Collect<&mut P, &mut Container>` →
  `L::Span`) destinations are untouched, and each of the three now has exactly one output on its
  own `Self` type. `Collect`'s documentation carries the rule.

- **`conformance::Harness::run` requires `L::Token: PartialEq` and `<L::Token as Token>::Error:
  PartialEq`** (#269). It required nothing beyond `Lexer` before, and that is what the defect was:
  check 1 is documented as identity of the *item*, and with no equality to call the kit
  substituted the two things it could reach — the error's `Debug` rendering and the token's
  `kind`. `run_partial` has asked for both bounds since 0.10.0, so this is the same obligation on
  the other entry point rather than a new one, and the two tiers now differ only in `Offset =
  usize`, a prefix-sliceable source and `State: Clone`.

  **Who this excludes.** A vocabulary whose token or error type genuinely cannot be `PartialEq` —
  one holding an `Arc<dyn Error>`, a closure, a handle — loses the kit, since every tier runs from
  `run` or `run_partial`. Recovering it costs a `#[derive(PartialEq)]`, a hand-written impl where
  derivation is wrong, or a newtype whose equality is the one the vocabulary means; nothing about
  the lexer changes. There is no in-tree vocabulary among the excluded — this crate ships no
  concrete `Token` implementation at all — and the bundled logos adapter is transparent:
  `LogosLexer<T>` takes its `Token` and `Error` from the caller and constrains neither.

  The alternative to a bound is a caller-supplied comparator or key, and `run_partial` settled
  that trade already: a hand-written projection is silently escaped by the next field added, which
  is the failure mode the rendering had.

  `Item`'s private fields move with it — the kit keeps the `Result` `lex()` already handed it
  instead of a `kind` plus a `format!("{err:?}")` `String`, so the repair costs an allocation per
  error item less than what it replaces.

- **`PrattRHS` gains a variant, so an exhaustive `match` on it stops compiling** (#274). The new
  arm is `Adjacent(Precedenced<L, Power>)` — see **Added**. Every in-tree `match` on `PrattRHS`
  was a driver's; grammar code builds these values rather than reading them, so the expected
  downstream cost is a classifier that wraps or forwards a report. `PrattRHS` is deliberately not
  `#[non_exhaustive]`: a wildcard arm on this enum is a grammar silently declining a continuation
  the driver could have served, which is the class of defect `PrattRHS::End` exists to make
  spellable rather than inferable.

  Nothing else moves. No fold hook, no CST kind, no type parameter and no bound changed — the new
  variant reuses the left-associative operator type and folds through `PrattFoldInfix` as
  `PrattInfix::Left`.

- **`UnclosedEmitter::emit_unclosed` no longer imposes `Self::Error: FromUnclosed`, and `Fatal`
  and `Verbose` implement the trait only where their error type carries that conversion** (#270).
  The bound was on the trait method, so it was charged to every *caller* of the capability rather
  than to the implementations that perform the conversion. `Silent<E>` could not call its own
  no-op unless `E` implemented a conversion its body never performs; a generic function bounded by
  `UnclosedEmitter` — or by `ComposableEmitter`, which advertises the member — could not call it
  without restating the bound; and twenty delimited/list driver where-clauses restated it on the
  error type of an emitter that might never convert anything. All of those are gone, along with
  the restatements on `InputRef::emit_unclosed`, `EmitterView::emit_unclosed` and the `&mut U` and
  `Sink` forwarders, which now inherit the inner capability and nothing else.

  **This is `PrattEmitter`'s arrangement, not a new one.** The same defect was removed from
  `Silent`'s pratt impl in 0.9, leaving a bound-free method with `FromPrattError` on `Fatal`'s and
  `Verbose`'s impl blocks. The delimiter capability was the last member of the family that still
  derived a requirement from trait surface rather than from behaviour.

  **What breaks.** `Fatal<E>` and `Verbose<E, S>` used to satisfy `UnclosedEmitter` — and so
  `ComposableEmitter` — for every `E`, while the method they advertised could not be called unless
  `E: FromUnclosed`. They now satisfy it exactly where `E: FromUnclosed`, so the obligation is
  reported at the bundle bound rather than at a call the consumer could never write. A downstream
  emitter whose own body performs the conversion states `Self::Error: FromUnclosed` on its impl
  block; one that merely repeats the bound on the method compiles unchanged wherever its error
  type really implements the conversion. `ComposableParseContext` already required
  `Error: FromTokenErrors`, which names `FromUnclosed`, so nothing driving through the context
  bundle pays anything new.

  **Splitting the trait was the alternative, and it relocates the defect.** A bound-free
  `UnclosedEmitter` beside a converting sibling forces `ComposableEmitter` to include one of them:
  the converting one fails `Silent` verbatim, and the bound-free one stops covering the delimited
  driver the bundle exists for.

- **`RecoveryState`, `FromComponents` and `Components` live in `tokora::types::recovery` and are
  reached by naming it; `Status` is also re-exported as `tokora::types::Status`** (#320). A glob of
  `tokora::types::*` therefore gets the status type, and the traits are one import away:
  `use tokora::types::recovery::{RecoveryState, FromComponents, Components};`.

  **A measured table came out of settling this, and it is worth keeping on its own.** With the
  consumer's source held fixed, the library gaining one item, and — this is the part an earlier
  attempt got wrong — **both sides exposing the item the consumer reaches for**:

  | kind       | vs an extern crate of that name  | vs a second glob            | vs a local def |
  |------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|
  | **module** | **silent redirect**              | `E0659`                     | local wins     |
  | **type**   | **silent redirect**              | `E0659`                     | local wins     |
  | **trait**  | `E0790`                          | **silent, first glob wins** | local wins     |
  | fn / const | no interaction (value namespace) | `E0659`                     | local wins     |

  The `type` row was first read as `E0599`, loud. That was a probe that could only be loud — it
  asked the shadowing type for an associated item it did not have. With a dependency aliased
  `Status` exporting `Error`, and tokora's `Status` carrying an `Error` variant with an inherent
  `is_error()`, `Status::Error.is_error()` compiles on both revisions and the boolean inverts. So
  **no kind is loud on both axes.**

  **The placement is not derived from that table.** A draft read it as a budget and chose by
  counting collidable names; that was the wrong criterion. The line this release is drawn on is:
  **tokora must not silently change what a method on a tokora type means, while a name a consumer's
  own glob shadows is that glob's cost and `::` is its fix.**

  Those are two axes. `literal.is_valid()` on a `Lit*`, `Ident` or `Keyword` is the first — the
  consumer holds tokora's type, calls what they believe is their own check, and gets tokora's
  answer — and every carrier repair in this release is that class. `Status` in `types::*` and the
  `recovery` module are the second: a path into the consumer's own namespace shadowed by a glob
  they wrote, in code unrelated to tokora's carriers, with `::` as the remedy in both cases. Note
  that *loud versus silent* does not sort them — the module clashes loudly and `Status` can clash
  quietly — which is why the deciding property is whose type the call is on. It is also a rule
  nothing could follow: no public module or vocabulary type could ever be added again.

  **The module keeps the name `recovery`, and the check behind that is dated rather than argued.**
  Against the crates.io API on 2026-08-27: `recovery` 0.1.6, ~16.1k downloads, last updated
  2025-09-14, whose docs instruct `use recovery::Recovery;`. `Recovery` is not one of this module's
  names, so a consumer of both crates gets `E0432` at their own import line — measured, plus
  `E0659` where the name is then used — never a redirect. A rename was drafted on the mistake above
  and withdrawn.

- **The recovery carriers keep `PartialEq`/`Eq` derived, and only the other four are hand-written**
  (#320). Replacing all six derives dropped the compiler-generated `StructuralPartialEq`, so a
  `const` of a carrier could no longer appear in a `match` pattern — *"constant of non-structural
  type"*. That was an unannounced break against 0.9, and it slipped through because the change was
  verified by **rendering**: `Debug`'s field order, `PartialEq`'s short-circuit order, `Hash`'s
  bytes. Structural matching is not observable that way; only using a value in a pattern shows it.

  Both properties cannot be had at once, and the split is where the evidence put it. Keeping
  `PartialEq`/`Eq` derived restores structural matching **only when the marker itself satisfies
  them**, because a derive still constrains every parameter — verified, not assumed: with the
  derive restored and a marker carrying no traits at all, the pattern is still rejected.

  So the **residual cost** is stated: comparing or pattern-matching a carrier still needs its
  language marker to be `PartialEq + Eq`, exactly as 0.9 required. Printing, cloning, copying and
  hashing no longer need anything of it. Four of the six bounds dropped, structural matching
  unchanged — strictly better than 0.9 on every axis, which is why this is not a choice between
  two breaks.

- **The recovery carriers stop demanding traits of their language marker** (#320). `Ident`,
  `Keyword`, the seventeen `Lit*` types and `IdentList` derived `Debug`, `Copy`, `Clone`,
  `PartialEq`, `Eq` and `Hash`, and a derive constrains **every** type parameter — so each of the
  six carried a `Lang:` bound that nothing in the body uses, since `PhantomData<T>` implements all
  six for any `T` unconditionally. `Ident<&str, SimpleSpan, MyLang>` was therefore not printable,
  copyable, comparable or hashable unless the consumer derived those on the marker too, for a
  reason that does not exist. `IdentList` demanded it twice over: `S` appears only in
  `PhantomData<S>` and in the default container type, so `S: Debug` was spurious as well.

  The six are now written out with bounds naming only the parameters the body reads.
  **Nothing else changes**: `Debug` prints the same fields in declaration order, `PartialEq`
  short-circuits in the same order, and `Hash` feeds the same bytes, because `PhantomData` hashes
  nothing. Listed as breaking only because an impl's bounds are part of the surface — every
  program that compiled before still compiles, and some that did not now do.

  This is filed here rather than as a follow-up because #320's first draft **worked around it in a
  doctest**, adding `#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq)]` to a marker to make the example
  build. Published documentation that teaches a consumer to derive four traits on a marker for a
  reason that is not real is worse than the bare defect, so the workaround is gone and the example
  now stands as a consumer would write it — which is also the regression test.

- **`IntoComponents::Components` on all nineteen recovery carriers becomes
  `types::recovery::Components { span, payload, status }` — a named struct, not a tuple** (#320). `Ident`, `Keyword` and the
  seventeen `Lit*` types hold a span, a payload and a recovery status, and returned two of the
  three. The trait's own contract is that a decomposition is complete with no information loss,
  and the test of that is whether the output rebuilds the input: it did not, so
  `LitDecimal::error(span)` and `LitDecimal::new(span, "<error>")` decomposed **identically**, and
  anything that took a carrier apart and put it back together through `new` reported a recovery
  placeholder as valid syntax — the laundering #303 removed from `Ident::map`, reached one door
  over. `Keyword`'s inherent `into_components`, which wins the pick over the trait's at an
  unqualified call site, widens with it and the trait impl now delegates to it so the two shapes
  cannot drift.

  **`Ident` is included even though it predates this**, because it is the model the #266 rule
  points at and the type this branch held up as correct; a model with the hole teaches the hole,
  and leaving it would have left `Ident::into_components` returning a 2-tuple beside `Keyword`'s
  3-tuple.

  Migration is a compile error at every site: `let (span, src) = x.into_components();` becomes
  `let Components { span, payload, .. } = …`. Withdrawing the impls was the alternative and is
  worse: for an owned payload `into_components` is the only extraction that does not clone, and
  withdrawal removes a capability where completing it is what was needed.

  **A three-tuple was tried first and is not safe**, which is why the shape is a struct. Widening
  `(Span, Payload)` to `(Span, Payload, Status)` was defended on the grounds that the arity changes
  and every stale destructuring therefore breaks loudly. One line defeats that:

  ```rust,ignore
  let (_, .., value) = literal.into_components();
  value.is_valid()
  ```

  `..` matches zero elements against a pair and one against a triple, so `value` is the payload
  before and the status after. Both compile whenever the payload also answers `is_valid`, and
  since `new` assigns `Status::Valid`, a payload the caller's own check rejects then reports
  valid. `(.., b)` and `.1` are the same defect in other spellings.

  That was the third exemption of its kind refuted in this release — after *the return type
  differs* and *the argument type is a `Status`* — and all three failed the same way: each
  estimated what a consumer could have written, and estimated it too small. So this is not a
  better-argued exemption but a shape no tuple pattern can match at all. Ten shapes were compiled
  against both the old pair and the new struct: `(a, b)`, `(_, b)`, `(a, ..)`, `(_, .., b)`,
  `(.., b)`, a trailing comma, `ref` bindings, a `match` arm, `.0` and `.1`. All ten build against
  the pair — that is the control — and all ten are refused against the struct, with `E0308` for the
  patterns and `E0609` for the index accesses. Eight of them are `compile_fail` doctests on
  `Components` with the codes pinned, and the pinning was itself checked by planting a wrong code.

  It is the better API besides: three positional parts whose third is a status is exactly the
  shape that made `..` dangerous, and a named field says which is which.

  **The stated residual.** A consumer who never looks inside the value keeps compiling —
  `format!("{:?}", x.into_components())`, or passing it to a generic sink. What they observe
  changes; what they can *extract* does not, because every pattern, index and typed argument is
  now refused. There is no spelling that silently hands back the status where the payload used to
  be.

- **`CachedToken::state` and `CachedToken::into_components` are crate-internal** (#311). The regime
  a cached token carries is now an opaque payload: carried, cloned and moved, never read.

  **This is the same hole as the accessor above, reached through the cache.** A cached token's
  `State` is the regime that produced it, and the input **installs** it when the token is consumed.
  Prefill a token, capture a scanner attempt, flip a `Cell<Mode>` in that token's post-state through
  `InputRef::cache()`, then consume it inside a failing `try_attempt`: the scan trips under the
  altered mode, the rollback restores the live state, the regime id and the offset **while the
  consumed pre-save entry stays absent**, and the retry re-lexes from an unaltered state and can
  succeed — over an input `scanner_outcome` has just called `Stalled`. That is a legitimately
  deep-cloned `State`, not the shared-counter violation, so it was inside the boundary the previous
  entry drew.

  **The cut is at the type, not at the doors.** Every public surface that hands out lookahead hands
  out a `CachedToken` — `InputRef::cache()` and the `Cache` views behind it, `peek_one`, every
  `peek*` and `sync_*_then_peek*` — so closing the projection closes all of them at once, including
  the ones nobody has written yet. `token`, `into_token`, `as_ref`, `map_token` and `Clone` stay
  public, so a `Cache` implementation stores, returns, splits and clones entries exactly as before;
  it never needed to read one. `CachedToken::new` was already crate-internal, so a regime cannot be
  fabricated either — a cache can only hand back entries it was given.

  **Blast radius: nothing in this workspace changed.** `cargo check --all-features --all-targets`
  is clean without a single call-site edit — the conformance kit, the fuzz harness, the benches and
  every test compile untouched, because the projection had no consumer outside `cache` itself.
  A downstream consumer that read a peeked token's post-state loses that; `into_token` gives the
  token and span.

  `InputRef::cache()` itself is **kept**. With the regime unprojectable it exposes nothing unsound,
  and withdrawing a diagnostic accessor that no longer leaks would be breakage bought for nothing.
  The full per-projection enumeration, derived from the types that hold an `L::State` rather than
  from the doors that were found, is on `InputRef::scanner_outcome`.

- **`InputRef::state`, `ParseState::state` and `Checkpoint::state` return the state BY VALUE**
  (#311). They handed out `&L::State`; they now hand out an owned clone.

  **A shared reference to the live state is a public path to scan-visible state that skips every
  door this crate tracks.** `State` is bounded `Debug + Clone` and nothing more, so a valid one may
  hold interior mutability — a `Cell<Mode>` a grammar flips to change how the region ahead lexes.
  Through a `&L::State`, safe code could flip it without `set_state` or `state_mut`, and the input
  would scan under a regime nothing on it records: `InputRef::scanner_outcome` would then answer
  `ScannerOutcome::Stalled` — *repeating reproduces the trip* — over an input where repeating now
  succeeds, and reject a recoverable parse. `Checkpoint::state` is the same hole one step back,
  since the state a checkpoint holds is one a restore will install.

  The alternative was to ask `State` implementors for a comparable identity. That moves an
  obligation onto every downstream lexer that no compiler checks — a defaulted trait method walks
  implementors straight past it, and a required one breaks all seven in-crate impls and every
  downstream one while still being satisfiable by returning a constant. **Removing the capability
  is enforced; requesting the discipline is not.**

  **The blast radius is narrower than the signature suggests.** `inp.state().field` and
  `inp.state().method()` both keep compiling, through auto-ref on the temporary; what breaks is
  binding the reference (`let s: &L::State = inp.state();`) and dereferencing it. Measured across
  this workspace: **two call sites**, both `*state.state()` in a test. The cost is one
  `L::State::clone` per read — `state()` is a diagnostic accessor, not a scan path, and `state_mut`
  (which re-keys eagerly) remains the way to change the regime.

  What is **not** covered is a `Clone` that *shares* its interior mutability rather than
  deep-copying it — an `Rc<Cell<_>>` tally and its family. That is already the `Lexer` determinism
  clause's own named violation (*"a shared counter"*), and the input layer's behaviour under one is
  unspecified-but-bounded, here as everywhere else on this branch.

- **`RecursionLimiter::PARSE_DEFAULT_DEPTH` is 32, in every build, and was 16** (#297). Every
  unconfigured parse gets twice the depth. The profile arms hold the same number, deliberately, and
  what a release build actually supports is published separately as the new
  **`RecursionLimiter::OPTIMIZED_PARSE_DEPTH`** — 256, installed by nothing.

  **Why 16 was wrong is measured, not argued.** It came from applying `MIN_HEADROOM` to a consumer
  grammar's abort depth of 51 — a reading of that consumer's *syntactic* door, which takes no
  `InputRef::descend` and therefore spends none of this budget. The door that does spend it aborts
  at 667. The entry under **Fixed** has the sweep, the axes and the survive/abort pairs.

  **The criterion is two-tier, and the asymmetry is the decision rather than a convenience.** This
  cell is *shared*: `InputContext::new` seeds it for tokora's two Pratt engines (~16.4 KiB a frame),
  for a caller's own hand-written `descending` (modelled at the measured heaviest, ~41 KiB), and for
  a lossless consumer's descent (~3.1 KiB) — a 68x span, and no single row bounds it. So:

  - **full `MIN_HEADROOM` against every population that actually *spends* the cell** — tokora's own
    125 and the consumer's 667, minimum 125; `32 x 3 = 96 < 125`, and `64 x 3 = 192` is not;
  - **a bare fit, no multiplier, at the heaviest population that is only *modelled*** —
    `32 x 41 120 B = 1.31 MiB < 2 MiB`, and `64 x 41 120 B = 2.51 MiB` is not.

  **Applying the multiplier to the modelled row as well gives 16; applying only the fit to the
  spending rows gives 128. 32 is exactly the width of that distinction**, and it ships documented as
  a criterion rather than as a number. 128 is refused by a measurement: it is *above* tokora's own
  125, so an unconfigured Pratt parse in a debug build would reach the native stack before the
  limiter — `128 x 16 112 B` measured is 98.3% of a 2 MiB thread.

  **The two profile arms hold one number, and the reason is not a missing measurement.** The release
  sweep exists and says 256. What is missing is any way for this crate to know whether the condition
  256 rests on holds. `debug_assertions` is not `opt-level`, so `debug-assertions = false` at
  `opt-level = 0` selects the release arm at unoptimised frame prices; and it is **per crate**,
  while the frames this budget bounds are the **caller's** — so a build script reading cargo's
  `OPT_LEVEL` would close the first gap and not the second, and a debug consumer against a release
  tokora reinstates the mismatch with every signal available here reading "release". **A number
  only safe when a fact holds, selected by a flag that cannot observe that fact, is not a default.**
  A `const` assertion now prices *both* arms at the debug cost, which is the guard that held before
  this campaign and the one whose loss made an intermediate revision unsafe.

  **`OPTIMIZED_PARSE_DEPTH` (new, `pub`) is 256** — the same two-tier derivation over the release
  rows: `256 x 3 = 768 < 3282`, and `256 x 4 452 B = 1.09 MiB < 2 MiB` where `512` needs 2.17 MiB
  and is refused. **No new API is owed to use it**: `RecursionLimiter::with_limitation`,
  `InputContext::with_recursion_limiter`, `ParserContext::with_recursion_limiter` and
  `cst::parse_lossless_with_context` all predate this change. The constant exists because a
  measurement nobody can reach is not an opt-in — without it a consumer would have to re-run the
  bisection to arrive at a figure this crate already knows. **The precondition is the caller's to
  check**: every frame the budget bounds, theirs included, compiled at `opt-level = 3`.

  **What a caller does.** Nothing, unless they relied on 16 as an upper bound — a parse that refused
  at 17 levels now accepts up to 32. A release deployment that wants the depth its profile supports
  passes `OPTIMIZED_PARSE_DEPTH` explicitly. Nothing about a *configured* parse changes.

  `SEGMENTED_PRATT_DEPTH` is unchanged at 1024. A release per-level figure to derive it from now
  exists and would give 8192; it stays a floor because that is a decision about how much segment
  *memory* an unconfigured parse may reach, not one the stack sweep licensed.

- **`TokenBudget` is the ceiling; `input::TokenBudgetTally` is what one `Input` spent against it.**
  `TokenBudget::{spent, is_exhausted, refused_an_item}` are gone from that type and live on the new
  one, and `InputRef::token_budget` now returns `&TokenBudgetTally`. Every existing *read* — `inp
  .token_budget().spent()`, `.is_exhausted()`, `.refused_an_item()`, `.limitation()` — compiles
  unchanged, because that is where those questions were always asked. What breaks is reading them
  off a `TokenBudget` **value a caller owns**, where the answers were meaningless: a caller can only
  hold a freshly-constructed one, so `spent()` was `0` and `refused_an_item()` was `false` by
  construction.

  It is a repair, not a tidy-up. `TokenBudget` is `Copy` — both `with_token_budget` doors are public
  and take it by value — and while the spend and the one-shot probe latch rode in it, `Copy` carried
  the **live cell** through those doors. `*input.token_budget()` out of a parse that had refused,
  into the next context, and the next `Input` began exhausted with a refusal already on record and
  no poison boundary: its first driver gate counted a scanner trip and reported a *terminal* stop
  with `Lexer::lex` never invoked — over an empty source included. Reproduced at `6aa0b08` through
  `ParserContext::with_token_budget` and through a caller-written `ParseContext` reaching
  `InputContext::with_token_budget`, both reading `(Err(terminal), refused_an_item = true, 0
  scans)`, and again as a `PartialSession` redrive whose second attempt read `items = 0,
  refused_an_item = true, 0 scans`.

  That is this budget's own reason for existing, pointed backwards. The counter is durable so that a
  rollback cannot refund work that happened; a transplantable counter fabricates work that did not.
  The split is what makes the fabrication **unrepresentable**: a tally has no `Clone`, no `Copy` and
  no public constructor, an `Input`'s tally is built from the configuration and from nothing else,
  and the configuration is a ceiling with nothing else in it.

  Migration: nothing, unless you called `spent()`, `is_exhausted()` or `refused_an_item()` on a
  budget you built yourself. Those answers are now asked of the input that has one.

- **`InputContext::into_components` returns a four-tuple** (#285): `(emitter, cache, recursion,
  token_budget)`. It is destructuring rather than four getters *precisely* so that adding a
  component breaks every rebuild of a context, and this is the first time that has fired. A rebuild
  goes through `InputContext::new`, which re-seeds the defaults, so a component a rebuild forgets to
  re-apply is silently replaced by its default — for the token budget that means an untrusted parse
  running unbounded while the caller's code still reads as if it had asked for a ceiling, and an
  unbounded budget never refuses, so there is no diagnostic anywhere. Migration is one binding:
  `let (e, c, r) = …` becomes `let (e, c, r, b) = …`, and a caller that rebuilds a context must
  thread `b` back through `with_token_budget`.

- **`Emitter::checkpoint` takes `&mut self`** (#257). Capturing a mark is a capability, not an
  observation — for a recording emitter it registers per-mark state a later `rewind` or `release`
  must find, and the input layer owns the lineage those marks belong to. The `&self` receiver put
  that capability on *every* shared reference to an emitter, and two of those are public and
  documented as observation-only: `InputRef::emitter_ref` and `EmitterView::emitter_ref`, which
  exist so a parser can read a concrete emitter's own state mid-parse. The module header claimed
  the boundary held — "a **shared** reference cannot re-enter an emitter slot: every recording
  method on the trait family takes `&mut self`" — and that was true of every *recording* method
  and false of the one that captures.

  What it cost, through stable safe public APIs and the built-in sink:
  `Emitter::checkpoint(inp.emitter_ref())` pushed a mark-stack row that no `InputRef` checkpoint
  lineage owned and no settle would ever spend. A row's index is a structural floor for
  `emit_skipped_region`'s hole wrap, so a recovery whose diagnostic spanned both tokens of `"ab"`
  produced an error node covering `"b"` alone — a materialized, fully covered, silently wrong
  tree rather than a refusal. Repeated calls retained one row each until the sink was consumed.

  Documenting the obligation was the alternative, and it is the class of promise this crate has
  been removing: a source census over the crate's own call sites cannot reach a downstream
  caller, and the type signature said the call was allowed. The receiver says otherwise now, and
  it says it for every emitter rather than for the one whose corruption was found. Two things
  follow. `Sink::rows` is a plain `Vec` again — it was a `RefCell` **only** to satisfy the
  `&self` receiver, so the sink now holds no cell at all and `&Sink` is observation-only
  structurally rather than by convention. And an emitter that reached for interior mutability
  for the same reason can drop it too.

  Migration is the receiver and nothing else: an `impl Emitter` writes `fn checkpoint(&mut
  self)`. A caller that reached the method through a shared reference wanted an observation, and
  should ask for one — `Verbose`'s mark, for instance, *is* its emission-log length, which
  `Verbose::diagnostics().len()` reports without capturing anything. What a shared reference
  still cannot promise is anything about a concrete emitter's *own* interior mutability; Rust has
  no bound that excludes it, so that is now stated on both accessors as a logic error in the
  terms `HashSet` uses for a key, and deliberately enumerates nothing.

- **`Errors`' `DerefMut` and its derived `AsMut<C>` impl are removed** (#247). `overflowed()`
  promises to report whether any error was dropped for want of capacity, and that fact exists
  nowhere but the wrapper: a bounded container that is full and one that is full *and has refused
  ten errors* are the same container, so the flag cannot be derived and has to be maintained.
  Only `push`/`try_push` maintained it — and `DerefMut`, with the derived `AsMut<C>` beside it,
  handed callers the container's own insertion API, through which a bounded container rejected a
  value, returned it, and `overflowed()` went on saying `false`. In a `no_std` or otherwise
  bounded configuration that is silent diagnostic truncation, reported as complete.

  Both doors are gone rather than documented, for the reason #279 removed `as_mut_slice`: some
  invariants can be maintained behind the caller's back and this one cannot. Removing only
  `DerefMut` would have relocated the door rather than closed it, which is why the derived
  `AsMut<C>` went with it.

  What survives is everything that cannot invent a dropped error. The shared views are untouched
  (`Deref`, the derived `AsRef<C>`, `IntoIterator for &Errors`, `Display`), `AsMut<[E]>` still
  hands out the elements where the container is contiguous, and three inherent methods replace
  what the removed doors were legitimately used for: `Errors::pop`, `Errors::clear` and
  `Errors::iter_mut` — the last bounded on the method (`&'a mut C: IntoIterator<Item = &'a mut
  E>`) rather than on `ErrorContainer`, so it costs no existing container implementation
  anything. None of the three can create the fact `overflowed` reports, and none clears it
  either: it is historical, and removing an error that *is* held does not un-drop one that never
  entered. A caller that inserted through the container moves to `try_push`, which reports the
  rejection the container's own door swallowed.

  As with #279, the shared side cannot be made structural: `C` is the caller's type and Rust has
  no bound against interior mutability, so a self-mutating container reaches the same state
  through `Deref`. That is stated generically on the type, in the terms `HashSet` uses for a key,
  and enumerates nothing.

- **`FromIterator<E>` and `From<E>` for `Errors<E, C>` are bounded on `ErrorContainer<E>` instead
  of `C: FromIterator<E>`, and collect through `try_push`** (#284). #247 above closed every door
  that *mutates* an already-wrapped container. Construction is an insertion door too, and it
  reached the same lie by a route that mutates nothing: `Errors::from_iter` delegated straight to
  `C::from_iter` and then set `overflowed_flag` to `false`. A bounded `C` collecting more errors
  than it holds can only keep what fits — `FromIterator` has no channel for reporting a value it
  refused — so `collect()` truncated silently and `overflowed()` reported clean over what was
  left. `From<E>` inherited it: into a zero-capacity `C` the sole error vanished with the flag
  still `false`. That is #247's defect one category over, reachable **without** `DerefMut` or
  `AsMut<C>`, and the enumeration that found those two could not see it because it enumerated
  mutation.

  Both conversions now take the container's own accounting answer instead of assuming there was
  nothing to answer. `From<E>` offers its one error to `try_push`; `FromIterator` hands the whole
  iterator to `ErrorContainer::from_errors` (above), which is a loop of that same `try_push` unless
  the container overrides it, and which reports what did not fit either way. `From<E>` stays
  **infallible**: a capacity *floor* is what would make it unconditionally lossless and there is
  nothing on `ErrorContainer` to express one with — `remaining_capacity(&self)` reads an instance, and an associated
  `const MIN_CAPACITY` would be a caller's declaration, which is the class of promise this type
  already refuses to rest on. The zero-capacity case is answered by the flag rather than by a
  `Result`.

  **The bound is a swap, not an addition, and it is the same bound that makes the flag readable at
  all.** `overflowed`, `push`, `try_push`, `pop`, `clear`, `remaining_capacity` and `with_capacity`
  all live on the `ErrorContainer<E>` impl, so a container that could *lie* about an overflow
  already satisfied the new bound and keeps its `collect()`. What it costs is `collect()` into a
  `C` that is `FromIterator<E>` and not an `ErrorContainer<E>` — `BTreeSet`, `HashSet`,
  `LinkedList` and the like, which yield an `Errors` with no insertion, no removal and no
  `overflowed()` at all, only the shared views. Those build with
  `Errors::from_container(iter.collect())`, one line and no loss. In the other direction it
  *gains* the containers with no `FromIterator` of their own, which is both of this crate's
  bounded ones — `Option<E>` and `ArrayDeque<E, N>`, so `DefaultContainer` in a no-alloc
  build had no `collect()` before this and has an accounting one now.

  The reservation the funnel makes is taken **after the first error is observed**, not from the
  size hint alone. A hint is a hint: an empty iterator reporting `usize::MAX` is a
  capacity-overflow panic if it is reserved for, where a delegated fill returns empty without
  allocating at all. `Vec`'s own `FromIterator` unrolls its first `next` ahead of its own reserve
  for the same reason. An overstated hint on a *non-empty* iterator still panics, as it does on a
  delegated fill — that is a protocol violation by the iterator, not a property of this change.

  **What the funnel costs, and why it is the container's default rather than the mechanism.**
  Offering the errors one at a time is what makes the count honest, and for a bounded container it
  is the only thing available. For an unbounded one it is a tax with no accounting to show for it:
  `Vec`'s and `VecDeque`'s `FromIterator` specialise on a `Vec`/`VecDeque` `IntoIter` and take the
  source's allocation outright, where a per-item fill holds the source buffer alive beside an
  equally large destination until the last error has been copied across. Measured over 1 Mi `u64`,
  zero allocations and a peak equal to the source became one allocation and a peak of twice it, and
  a fill that was O(1) at 13-17 ns for every length became 22 ns at 16 errors, 115 ns at 256,
  375 ns at 1024 and 1.29 ms at 1 Mi.

  **And peak is the wrong axis.** Between roughly one and two times the source in available memory
  the delegated fill completes and the per-item one asks for a second buffer it cannot get — and a
  failed allocation is not a diagnostic that a caller handles. It is `handle_alloc_error`, which
  aborts the process. So for a caller-controlled error count the funnel does not make an unbounded
  `collect()` slower, it **halves the largest collection that survives a given ceiling**: measured
  against a 12 MiB allocator ceiling, 1 572 864 `u64` errors collected before this change and
  786 432 with the per-item fill, the difference being an abort rather than a truncation.

  Which fill runs is therefore the container's own answer, through `ErrorContainer::from_errors`,
  whose **default is that per-item funnel**. `Vec` and `VecDeque` override it with their own
  `FromIterator`, and every number goes back to where it was: zero allocations, a peak equal to the
  source, and the same 1 572 864-error ceiling. That the override is *correct* rests on neither
  container being able to refuse an error; that it is *fast* rests on the standard library's
  in-place-collect specialisation, and a standard library that stopped specialising would leave an
  unbounded `collect()` costing what the funnel costs with the accounting exactly as sound.

  `Errors::from_container` is unchanged and is the one construction door that is deliberately
  *not* an insertion door: the caller builds the container, the wrapper adopts it, and the flag
  starts `false` covering only what is offered afterwards. Whether that container's own
  construction refused an error is a history the container does not record and no wrapper can
  read. The obligation is stated on the method, and unlike a residual it can be discharged — a
  caller filling a bounded container *from errors* has `collect()`, `From`, `push` and `try_push`,
  and all four now account.
- **The parser's default recursion budget drops from 64 to 16**, in every build and under every
  feature. **64 was above the depth at which a real grammar aborts**, which made the limiter
  unreachable for that grammar: the native stack got there first, with `fatal runtime error: stack
  overflow` and no diagnostic. It had been derived from tokora's own worst measured cell — the
  debug token driver's 125 frames at ~16.4 KiB on a 2 MiB thread — with ~1.9× of margin, and that
  is the wrong table. A consumer's grammar does not sit beside tokora's recursion, it sits
  **inside** it: the productions the driver calls are the consumer's, so one level of nesting pays
  for a tokora frame *and* a consumer frame. Measured on a real consumer grammar, debug, on the
  same 2 MiB thread: it aborts at **51** levels — ~41 KiB each, 2.5× tokora's own — with four
  further axes at 60, 57, 53 and 52.

  16 is the largest power of two leaving more than 3× under that binding cell of 51. The next one
  up, 32, leaves 1.59×, which is *below* the 1.9× that made 64 look safe and well inside the range
  another platform's codegen moves. The direction to err in is settled by the asymmetry this
  constant has always documented: too low returns a clean, catchable `RecursionLimitReached` naming
  the knob that raises it, while too high aborts the process and takes the caller's program with
  it. Only one of those can be recovered from.

  **A grammar that legitimately nests deeper must now say so** — through
  `with_recursion_limiter` on either context type, and, for a lossless parse, through the
  `parse_lossless_with_context` pair added in this release. The one place that could not say so
  used to be `parse_lossless` / `parse_lossless_partial`, which built their own context; lowering
  the default without that hatch would have been a break with no remedy for a lossless consumer
  whose documents nest between 16 and 64, so the two ship together.

  **Enabling `stacker` is not the way to raise it**, and for one revision of this branch it was:
  the feature moved this constant to 1024. It segments tokora's two Pratt frame prologues and
  nothing else, so it says nothing about a consumer's own `descend`/`descending` frames — which
  read the same shared cell. See `SEGMENTED_PRATT_DEPTH` above for the figure it does justify.

  The derivation is no longer prose, and it is no longer a range. `PARSE_DEFAULT_DEPTH`,
  `SEGMENTED_PRATT_DEPTH`, the red zone and the segment size are each asserted **equal** to a value
  computed from a measurement and a named policy, with the arithmetic behind that computation
  asserted separately — so a tree whose constants contradict their own table does not compile. The
  earlier guards were inequalities only, which is weaker than it reads: they imposed upper bounds
  alone, so a default of **1** satisfied every predicate and the segmented block accepted anything
  from **501 to 1632**. Putting the default back to 64 now fails the build by name, and so does
  putting it to 1, 32 or 512.

- **`IncompleteSyntax::as_mut_slice` and its `AsMut<[S::Component]>` impl are removed** (#245).
  The type documents its components as a *set*: insertion deduplicates, nothing removes, and
  every other door preserves that. An unrestricted `&mut [Component]` is the one door that did
  not — `error.as_mut_slice()[1] = Component::A` writes a duplicate the type says cannot exist,
  and equality, hashing and formatting then observe a state the contract rules out. The door is
  gone because it needed no cooperation from `Component` at all — the widest possible route to
  the same duplicate. It is not the only route: `Component` is not, and cannot be, bounded
  against interior mutability (Rust has no stable bound for that), so a `Component` wrapping a
  `Cell` or an atomic can still reach a duplicate through the surviving shared views. That is
  now a documented logic error, in the terms `HashSet` and `HashMap` use for the same hazard on
  a key — not a claim that uniqueness is structural (#279). The shared views are unaffected:
  `as_slice`, `AsRef<[S::Component]>`, `iter`, `len` and `Display` all stay, and all of them got
  *more* complete in the same change. A caller that reordered or rewrote components rebuilds
  from `iter` — `S::Component` is only `Clone + Eq + Hash + Display`, so there was never a
  generic sort to lose.

- **`Lexer` gains a required method, `read_frontier`, and the partial-input holdback keys on it
  instead of on the item's span** (#282). The holdback that keeps a partial parse equivalent to
  the complete one used to withhold *the item whose span reaches the buffer end*. That is a
  **proxy** for "more input could change this item", and it is exact only for a lexer that never
  reads past what it emits. An ordered trial that attempts several readings and backtracks reads
  past the span it emits by construction, so the proxy committed exactly the items appending one
  byte would change: for the non-final prefix `5m5` a failed duration trial emits `Number("5")`
  spanning byte 0, and `5m5s` is one `Duration`.

  `read_frontier` reports the fact instead: **the maximum offset at which the lexer probed the
  input while deciding the item, inclusive, where a probe answered by end of input counts at the
  offset probed.** The driver withholds iff that frontier is **at or past the buffer end** —
  probing at `len` is precisely "end of input was observable". The convention is deliberately
  probe-*inclusive*; the exclusive reading does not count an end-of-input answer as a consult at
  all, so a decision that observed "there is no byte at offset k" could report below the buffer
  end and be committed, which is the break this fixes.

  **`ReadFrontier::SpanEnd` keeps the previous behaviour bit for bit.** It means *no probe beyond
  the item's own span end*, and it explicitly permits the terminator probe **at** `span.end` —
  the one-boundary-byte lookahead a maximal-munch lexer performs, which is safe because that byte
  is present exactly when the item is yielded. A lexer that answers `SpanEnd` is unaffected by
  this release except that it now has to say so.

  **Two other things move with it.** The driver computes `max(span.end, reported)`, so
  monotonicity is a property of the driver rather than of the ecosystem: a lexer reporting
  `ReadTo(0)` cannot un-withhold an item the previous rule withheld. And a withheld item's
  `Incomplete` now carries the **buffer end** rather than the item's span end. Those two
  coincided under the old predicate — the tests asserted the coincidence — and diverge under this
  one (span end 1, frontier 3); `Incomplete`'s offset is documented as the frontier the caller
  resumes from, and the span end would have claimed the input ran out at 1.

  **What a caller sees change.** A refill loop, a run driven to `seal`, and every
  [`Complete`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/input/struct.Complete.html) parse are
  unaffected. A caller that drives `Partial` non-final **exactly once** and treats `Incomplete`
  as failure will see tokens it used to be handed come back as `Incomplete`. Those commitments
  were the unsound ones, so withholding them is the fix — but it is visible, and for a lexer that
  answers `Unbounded` it is *every* token until the stream is sealed. That is sound and it is not
  free: the caller buffers the whole stream, every attempt re-lexes from the base under
  `RedriveFromBase`, and a `Budget` calibrated for one-token latency can trip terminally on a
  perfectly valid stream.

  **`cargo-semver-checks` did not catch this break, and its silence is not evidence.** The tool
  reports "semver requires new major version" for this release, but on the unrelated
  `IncompleteSyntax::as_mut_slice` removal above; `trait_method_added` **passed**. That is not a
  configuration accident — adding a fresh required method to a second public, unsealed, unimplemented
  trait (`Lexable`) reproduced the same PASS on cargo-semver-checks 0.49.0, stable toolchain,
  `--all-features`, against the published 0.9.1 baseline. The break here is recorded from the
  diff.

- **The `Lexer` contract's claim that the Logos backend is faithful under truncation was false,
  and is retracted** (#282). The clause asserted that "a maximal-munch lexer (the Logos backend,
  and every hand-written lexer that commits each item from its own bytes) satisfies this". It does
  not, and **no callback is required to break it**: `logos` backtracks to the last accepting prefix
  after probing past it, which is ordinary DFA behaviour and is not what its "prevents
  backtracking" README line is about (that one concerns ReDoS inside a single definition). With
  pure `#[regex]` rules for `[0-9]+`, `[0-9]+\.[0-9]+` and `[0-9]+e[+-]?[0-9]+`, `"1."` lexes as
  `Int@0..1  Dot@1..2` — the `Float` trial probed offset 2, found end of input, and rolled back —
  while `"1.5"` is one `Float@0..3`. Any vocabulary with a prefix-accepting longer pattern, which
  is most real vocabularies, was affected. The conformance kit's `run_partial` check already
  failed such a vocabulary under the previous holdback, so the falsifier predated the fix.

  Because `logos` exposes `span`, `slice` and `remainder` but not its probe frontier, the adapter
  cannot answer from anything it can see, and its blanket impl means the answer cannot come from
  an impl the dialect writes. It therefore delegates through **two** channels, both landing now:

  - `Token::SCAN_LOOKAHEAD`, a **required** const on the vocabulary, with no default. It
    answers for an item whose scan recorded nothing. Declaring `WithinSpan` is a claim about the
    generated DFA, and `run_partial` is what falsifies a wrong one; `Unbounded` is the answer
    that is always sound and never precise.

    **Every `Token` impl must add this line, and that is the point.** The const shipped in a
    first cut with a `ScanLookahead::Unbounded` default on the reasoning that an unaudited
    vocabulary must not be assumed safe — right value, wrong delivery, because a default also
    means the vocabulary is never asked. Every existing logos-backed impl kept compiling and
    silently became seal-only, and that is not a loss of precision: for a fixed one-byte token
    at span `0..1` in a two-byte non-final buffer, the old span predicate yields it (`1 < 2`)
    while the inherited `Unbounded` withholds it, and under a `Budget` calibrated for the
    yielding behaviour the sealing retry is refused before finality is ever applied. So the
    obligation matches the one `read_frontier` itself carries one layer up: required, so an
    implementor cannot be walked past it. Note the contrast with `Token::SURFACES_TRIVIA`, which
    keeps its default — omission there fails *closed at compile time*, because the lossless
    `cst::Sink` refuses to be built over an undeclared vocabulary; omission here failed *open at
    run time*.
  - `State::take_probe`, the **value** channel, taken out of the logos `Extras` — the one thing a
    `logos` callback can write to. A callback that peeks with
    `lexer.remainder()` knows exactly how far it looked and records the absolute offset — which
    is `lexer.span().end + n - 1` for `n` bytes successfully inspected past the match, since a
    span is half-open and `span.end` is already the first offset outside it; `span.end + n` is
    right only when the scan also reached for the byte at that offset and found end of input.
    It is defaulted to `None`, so no existing `State` impl breaks and a state that records
    nothing pays nothing.

    **It is ONE consuming operation, and that is a correction to the design.** The channel
    shipped in a first cut as two independently defaulted members — a `probe(&self)` reader
    beside a `clear_probe(&mut self)` reset — and that pair could be half-implemented. A `State`
    overriding the reader and inheriting the empty reset compiled, the adapter called a reset
    that did nothing, and a value carried in on a restored state survived into a scan that
    recorded nothing. Provenance then *accepted* it, because a rebuilt lexer can begin its first
    item at exactly the offset that value was keyed to — and a recorded value answers the
    frontier contract outright, so the vocabulary's honest `Unbounded` was never consulted.
    Non-final `"1."` with a state claiming a scan from 0 probed to 1: `read_frontier` answered
    `ReadTo(1)`, the driver's floor left it at `max(1, 1) = 1`, and `1 < 2` **committed**
    `Int@0..1` out of a buffer still being read; append `5` and the same bytes are one
    `Float@0..3`. That is the defect `SCAN_LOOKAHEAD`'s removed default had — a default
    that fails *open* — one level down, and the same repair does not apply: making the reset
    required would break every `State` impl including the ones that record nothing. Collapsing
    the pair does apply. Reading consumes, so there is no sibling to inherit or forget, and a
    state that implements nothing records nothing. The adapter calls the one method twice per
    `lex` — once before the scan, discarding whatever came in on the state, and once after,
    capturing what the scan recorded — and `LogosLexer` now holds the captured value, so
    `Lexer::read_frontier` stays the `&self` pure read the conformance kit's check 7 requires it
    to be.

  A recorded value answers the contract for its item outright, so it must cover the engine's
  backtracking too and not only the callback's own peek.

  **A value is accepted on provenance, not on freshness, because `Lexer::lex` is not one scan.**
  `logos` resolves `Skip` *inside* a single `next()` — recursively through `lex.trivia();
  T::lex(lex)` on 0.14/0.15, by `trivia()`-and-continue on 0.16 — so one call runs one DFA scan
  per skipped item plus the scan that produces the item, and several callbacks with them. A
  trivia callback records for a scan that yields nothing, and the scan that yields the item may
  run no callback at all; reading "a value is present" as "this item recorded it" hands the
  trivia's offset to the item. Because the skipped scan *precedes* the item, that offset is
  **below** the item's real frontier — the one direction that under-reports, which is the
  direction that lets an unstable item be committed. With a recording whitespace skip in front
  of a callback-free integer, non-final `"  1."` committed `Int@2..3`; append `5` and the same
  bytes are one `Float@2..5`, chunked equivalence broken on exactly the trivia-skipping path the
  holdback claims to cover.

  So the value is a `Probe`, carrying the offset its scan started at (`Probe::scanned_from`,
  which is `lexer.span().start` inside the callback) beside `Probe::probed_to`, and the adapter
  accepts it **iff that start equals the returned item's span start** — on the error arm exactly
  as on the token arm, since a callback may mutate `extras` and the item still arrive as an
  `Err`. Anything else falls back to `SCAN_LOOKAHEAD`, which the vocabulary had to write
  down. The check lives in the adapter rather than in a rule recorders must follow,
  because a recorder can only state a fact about the scan it is running in. The pre-scan take is
  kept beside it and is not redundant: an equal start is *evidence* of provenance, and a lexer
  rebuilt by `Lexer::with_state` + `Lexer::bump` — which is how `InputRef` resumes — can begin
  its first item at exactly the offset a restored state's value was keyed to.

- **`Harness::run_partial`'s non-final leg asks for a prefix rather than an equality** (#282). It
  required a non-final drain of `src[0..k]` to yield *exactly* the complete-parse tokens ending
  before `k`. Under the frontier holdback that is no longer attainable and never was the property:
  a lexer that reports reading past what it emits withholds more, and one that reports `Unbounded`
  withholds everything. Over-withholding is sound and converges — a refill strictly grows the
  buffer and sealing ends the game — so requiring equality would have failed every conforming
  lookahead lexer while testing precision instead of correctness. Yielding a token the complete
  parse does not have before the cut, or a different one at the same position, still fails, and
  the **final** leg still pins full equality. The trait tier also gains a check that
  `read_frontier` is a pure read: repeated calls agree, and asking does not move the lexer.

  **The sequence being prefix-checked is now items, not tokens: a lexer error the input layer
  raised is an item too.** Both legs previously drove the input under a discarding emitter, so the
  error arm was invisible to the check — and relaxing the length is exactly what made it invisible,
  because once a short answer is legal, "withheld at the frontier" and "reported and thrown away"
  are the same observation. A lexer that refused a region on a truncated buffer and tokenized it
  once the missing byte arrived produced an empty list against a token, which is a legal prefix.
  Two divergences that used to pass now fail: an item that is an **error** on the prefix and a
  **token** on the full input at the same span, and an **error whose payload changes** on append.
  Nothing from the diagnostic channel is compared: no rendered message, no severity, no labels.

  **Both arms are compared on the value, and `run_partial` therefore requires
  `L::Token: PartialEq` and `<L::Token as Token>::Error: PartialEq`.** Two blind spots closed
  together, because they were one:

  - the **token** arm kept only the kind and the span. A `Value(last_byte)`-shaped token holds one
    kind and a one-byte span while its payload is decided by a byte that has not arrived, so the
    prefix and the complete parse agreed on everything the tier compared and disagreed on the value
    a parser callback receives. `run()` and `run_partial()` both passed while the AST changed.
  - the **error** arm compared `format!("{payload:?}")`. That was defended on the ground that both
    sides come from the same build of the same lexer inside one call, so editing a `Debug` moves
    them together — which is true, and answers only the question of wording drift. `Debug` is not
    **injective**, so two payloads that render alike compare equal and a real drift passes; and it
    is not **stable**, so a rendering carrying an address or a counter reds a conforming lexer. The
    two failures run in opposite directions and no care with the rendering fixes both.

  Value equality fixes both at once. The bound is asked for at the entry point rather than taken as
  a caller-supplied key because a bound is *total* — every field participates, including one added
  later — while a hand-written key is a projection whose forgotten field is exactly the field that
  drifts, which is the failure mode the `Debug` rendering already had. This is the restricted entry
  point in any case: `Offset = usize`, a prefix-sliceable source and `L::State: Clone` were already
  required here and are not required by `run`. **A vocabulary with neither loses this tier and
  keeps every other**; recovering it costs a `#[derive(PartialEq)]`, or a hand-written impl where
  derivation is wrong (a payload holding a possibly-`NaN` float is not equal to itself). `run`'s
  bounds are unchanged.

  The kind is still compared beside the token. Redundant for any `PartialEq` that agrees with
  `Token::kind`, and kept because the two are independent caller code: a `PartialEq` coarser than
  the classification the parser sees would otherwise pass silently.

- **The combined update-and-check operations moved off `Tracker` and `RecursionTracker` onto
  `TrackerExt` and `RecursionTrackerExt`** (#265). `Tracker` keeps its four primitives
  (`increase_token`, `increase_recursion`, `decrease_recursion`, `check`) and `RecursionTracker`
  its three; `increase_token_and_check`, `increase_token_and_decrease_recursion{,_and_check}`,
  `increase_both{,_and_check}` and `increase_and_check` are now supplied by a blanket impl over
  every implementor. Callers add the `…Ext` trait to their imports — rustc names it in the
  method-not-found note — and get the same behaviour except where their tracker had overridden one
  of these, which is what **Fixed** covers. Implementors of `Tracker` or `RecursionTracker` that
  overrode a combined method get `E0119` and must move that logic into `check` or the primitive it
  belongs to; implementors that did not are unaffected.

  One repair keeps the defect: resolving the `E0119` by moving the override's body into an inherent
  `impl`. An inherent method with a combined operation's name wins *concrete* dot calls over the
  blanket — silently; no rustc or clippy lint reports the shadow (`clippy::same_name_method` does
  not see a blanket impl) — so that tracker's own callers keep the old narrow answer while every
  trait-resolved path gets the full check. Delete the override; whatever it computed beyond the
  composition belongs in `check` or a primitive.

- **Only Logos 0.16 is supported now; the `logos_0_14` and `logos_0_15` features, and the
  `logos@0.14`/`logos@0.15` optional dependencies behind them, are removed.** The crate carried
  three simultaneous Logos majors behind a newest-wins precedence chain — `tokora::logos`, the
  `LogosLexer` adapter re-export, and each macro-generated per-version `RecursionTracker` /
  `TokenTracker` / `Tracker` impl all picked 0.16, else 0.15, else 0.14 — and the CI job whose
  only purpose was running tests against 0.14 and 0.15 (`logos parity (0.14, 0.15)`; the
  `--each-feature` matrix only ever clippy-checked them). Both are retired with the versions
  themselves. `logos = ["logos_0_16"]` is unchanged: `--features logos` means what it always
  meant.

  The removal is mechanical everywhere the precedence chain existed only to pick the newest of
  three arms — the 0.16 arm is what survives, unconditionally. Every crate-level and item-level
  `#[cfg(any(feature = "logos_0_16", feature = "logos_0_15", feature = "logos_0_14"))]` gate —
  142 occurrences of the same disjunction across the library and the integration test suite —
  simplifies to `#[cfg(feature = "logos_0_16")]` for the same reason: `any` over one surviving
  alternative is that alternative. The guide and the README carry the same fact in prose, not in
  a `cfg`, and are corrected the same way. `ci/feature_cfg_coverage.py`'s derived leg count drops
  with it (28 multi-feature predicates over 322 sites, 49 covering legs, before; 25 over 308, 47
  legs, after) — a shrink in what the source actually asks for, not a loosened gate.

  BREAKING CHANGE: `logos_0_14` and `logos_0_15` no longer exist as Cargo features, and the
  `logos@0.14`/`logos@0.15` optional dependencies are gone from the manifest. A consumer building
  with `--features logos_0_14` or `--features logos_0_15` — naming a version directly rather than
  through the `logos` alias — fails to resolve the manifest rather than silently falling back.
  `tokora::logos` and the `LogosLexer` adapter now resolve to 0.16 unconditionally; a consumer
  who was pinned to 0.15 or 0.14 (whether through the version-specific feature or through a
  `Cargo.lock` that never re-resolved) must move to `logos_0_16` — via the `logos` alias or
  directly — to keep building.

### Changed

- **Documentation only: the restriction idiom and the chained-comparison one are stated on the API
  that carries them** (#202). Two idioms this crate supports and nothing in it named. A grep of the
  guide for "restriction" returned zero, so a reader coming from rust-analyzer or rustc — both of
  which thread a `Restrictions` bitset through expression parsing — could reasonably conclude that
  tokora has no answer. It does, in halves: the precedence half is `Pratt::min_precedence`, and the
  mode half is state on the channel *value*, since `parse_lhs` and `parse_rhs` are parsers the
  grammar constructs. Both are now said on `min_precedence` itself.

  `PrattFoldInfix` gains the chained-comparison note, and it is written as a list of what the fold
  is **missing** rather than as a recipe. The study that produced this item recorded that
  `fold_infix` has "both operators' spans in hand"; it has neither. `Precedenced` carries no
  position, `input.span()` at fold time is the frontier past the right operand, and the previous
  operator has to be recovered from the shape of `left` — which excludes the `O = ()` CST shape
  both in-tree CST examples use. Enriching `NonAssociativeChain` is still the wrong route, for the
  reason the study gave and that still checks out: the type has one `at` field and a
  two-more-offsets variant does not fit the driver's per-frame error budget.

  The lookahead-dependent report variant — `0..` as a postfix where `0..b` is an infix, the
  sub-case r-a gates with `Restrictions` — now has an in-tree witness in
  `tests/pratt_adjacent.rs`, where one operator reports all four variants off one token of
  lookahead while every one of them consumes what it reports.

### Fixed

- **`conformance::Harness::run` compares the item and not a rendering of it** (#269). Two fresh
  runs were held to agree on the error's `Debug` string and the token's `kind`, which the module
  header called identity of the token/error sequence. `Debug` is neither **injective** — two
  unequal error variants may render identically, and a hand-written `Debug` printing one label for
  a family of variants is legal and not rare, so a lexer whose error *value* changed between fresh
  runs was certified — nor **stable**: a rendering carrying an address or a counter differs
  between the two separately constructed lexers and reddened a lexer with no defect at all. The
  two run in opposite directions, so no amount of care with the rendering fixes both, and
  correcting the documentation to describe rendering-equality would have kept the false red.
  `kind` had the third failure of the same shape: a payload that moved between fresh runs kept its
  kind, its span and its slice, which was the whole comparison.

  The partial tier made this repair in 0.10.0 and the trait tier did not, so the argument, the
  bound and now the cells are the same on both. Three plants: an alternating error value behind one
  `Debug` spelling, an alternating token payload behind one kind, and the same error drift through
  a `with_state` resume, which is `check_resume`'s own comparison and not `assert_run_eq`'s. The
  control is `TickingErrLexer` — conforming, unstable `Debug` — now driven through `run` as well
  as `run_partial`.

- **The integration tier compares the committed item, and it compares both of its arms** (#269).
  The last tier still holding the key #269 removed. Its five schedules reduced every committed
  token to `(kind, span)` and threw the `L::Token` the drain loop had just been handed away, and
  they ran under `Silent`, which discards a lexer error outright. So a token payload that moved
  between two schedules of the same input — same kind, same span, same item count — was certified,
  and the whole error arm of the committed stream sat outside all five comparisons: a refusal
  leaves no token behind, so a lexer whose refusal payload moved between schedules produced five
  identical (empty) token streams.

  Both halves are the same defect the trait tier had, at the one tier neither #269 nor #295
  reached, and the fix is to stop projecting rather than to compare harder: the streams now hold
  `StreamItem` — the partial tier's own item type, renamed because it now serves both tiers that
  drive an `Input` — and every verdict is drawn from `StreamItem::compare`, the component-aware,
  reflexivity-aware path that already existed. The tier's local `(kind, span)` comparison is gone;
  a second implementation of one rule is what let the two drift in the first place. **This costs
  no new bound.** `run` already asks for the two `PartialEq`s, and retention is free: `Token` is
  bounded `Clone` and `Token::Error` is bounded `Clone`, both by the `Token` trait, so the tier
  excludes nobody it did not already exclude.

  **The two arms are compared as two sequences, not as one interleaved stream, and the error arm
  is not cross-checked against the raw lexer.** Both are facts about the input layer that a
  stronger-looking check would have gotten wrong, and both were written, run, and rejected by an
  existing positive cell rather than reasoned about. A `peek` reports a refusal the moment it
  lexes the region, so on `"a?b"` the straight drain observes `token, error, token` and
  `peek-heavy` observes `error, token, token` — both conforming, and an interleaved comparison
  reds `error_yielding_lexer_passes_every_check`. The layer also reports each refused region
  exactly once, keyed on a high-water mark, while the raw lexer may error over one span
  repeatedly: `RepeatErrLexer<80>` raises eighty and the layer raises one, and requiring equality
  there reds three positive cells. What survives both is what the tier now asserts — each arm's
  own sequence, per schedule, against the straight drain's.

  The emitter is now the partial tier's `ItemRecorder` rather than `Silent`, which is what puts a
  refusal in front of a comparison at all; its `checkpoint`/`rewind` was written for "a later
  schedule that does backtrack" and three of these five are it, so a restore rewinds the recorded
  errors in the same operation that rewinds the layer's dedup watermark. Two plants, one per arm:
  a token payload and an error payload, each keyed to the `Lexer::new` instance the drive was
  seeded from, so every trait-tier check passes and the straight drain and `peek-heavy` disagree.

- **The conformance kits report exactly what they established — no more and no less** (#324).
  #295 gave the kits one half of that rule: never state a diagnosis you did not establish. This is
  the other half, and the two are one rule. Every verdict-drawing comparison settled at the
  **first** difference it happened to reach, so an inconclusive one reached first buried every
  conclusive one behind it.

  Two instances, at two of the shared functions. `assert_run_eq` inspected shared items before
  checking stream length, so two fresh runs producing `[Tok(NaN)]` and `[Tok(NaN), Tok(0.0)]` —
  identical kind, span and slice at position 0 — reported `non-reflexive-payload` at position 0
  and never reached the length check, while the **extra item** proves replay divergence with no
  caller equality consulted at all. And `triple_compare` returned at the token, so a cache that
  accepts a push, hands back the correct span and the correct token and corrupts a perfectly
  **reflexive** `L::State` was called INCONCLUSIVE because `NaN != NaN` came first in its order,
  while the unexamined state mismatch convicts the cache on its own.

  **A conclusive difference outranks an inconclusive one, wherever both are available.** The first
  inconclusive difference is retained as a fallback and the search continues — into the remaining
  components of the same item, the later positions of the same stream, the item **count**, and the
  second arm of a two-arm law — and it is reported only if nothing conclusive is found anywhere.
  What counts as conclusive is a question about the two values the comparison ran on and not about
  the bound the component carries: a difference at the discriminant or in item count consults no
  caller equality at all, and a component comparison over two values that **each equal themselves**
  is sound — which is the ordinary case, the whole population of honest failures, and is not
  demoted by any of this.

  The rule lives in one place. `Ranking` carries it, `Comparison::ranked` spells it over a
  component list and `diverge` over two item streams; the cache kit's `PurityDecided` is gone,
  because it said exactly what `Divergence` says and two spellings of one answer are two places for
  the ordering between a position and a count to be decided wrongly — it was wrong in both.
  `Ranking` is generic over what a step answers, so the same rule composes over whole answers a
  level up: the integration tier's committed and raised-error arms were two `assert` calls in a
  fixed order, and `prefilled_purity` took the first half that diverged, and both carried the
  finding again. Nine plants, one per decision point.

  **What it costs.** On the passing path, nothing: every step short-circuits at the first
  conclusive difference, so a comparison whose components agree runs exactly what it ran before,
  and so does one that fails the ordinary way. On a **failure** path the kit runs more of the
  caller's `PartialEq` — the components behind an inconclusive one, the positions after it, the
  other arm — which is the same code the same run would have called had the earlier component
  agreed, over values the kit is already holding. A caller `eq` that panics can therefore panic
  where it was previously unreachable; that run was already going to abort, and no comparison here
  can turn a passing run red. `check_resume` is the one place where more of the *subject* runs: it
  collects its suffix before comparing, so a divergent resume lexes on to exhaustion under the same
  budget the passing path is already bounded by.

- **The kits owe a broken `Eq` the same answer they owe a broken `PartialEq`** (#324). A second
  population of verdict-drawing comparisons had no refusal at all — span/slice coherence,
  read-frontier purity, the span after exhaustion, gap-free tiling, and the cache kit's eleven
  span-valued laws — classified as settled by *total* equalities and therefore outside the guarded
  population. But `Eq` and `Ord` are markers and nothing checks the promise they make, so a lexer
  over a `Slice` whose `PartialEq` answers `false` to everything, itself included, got
  `span/slice-coherence`: a red naming their lexer, with `source LyingSlice("a"), slice()
  LyingSlice("a")` — two values that render identically. That is #295 verbatim at a site called
  exempt, and the exemption was not even self-consistent, since the same lying `L::Span` reaches an
  entry comparison a few lines below several of the cache sites and is refused there. Breaking `Eq`
  is a **stronger** caller defect than a `NaN`-capable `PartialEq`, not a defect outside this kit's
  reach; either way the comparison that failed was the caller's and the kit convicted nobody.

  Every equality any tier draws a verdict from is now built by one function, so the guarded
  population is a matter of construction rather than of a count in a comment: a comparison that
  does not come through it cannot produce the answer a verdict or a refusal is drawn from. The
  refusal keeps the `non-reflexive-payload` tag whatever the component, because the tag names the
  diagnosis #295 established and every cell and downstream grep keys on it; the component it names
  is what says whether a total or a partial promise was the one broken.

- **The conformance kits diagnose a payload that is not equal to itself instead of convicting the
  lexer or the cache** (#295). `PartialEq` promises symmetry and transitivity and **not**
  reflexivity, so a token payload holding an `f64` that can be `NaN` is not equal to itself. The
  partial tier's final leg compares the complete stream against a final drain of the *same*
  source, so such a payload failed a stream against itself: the kit raised `partial-equivalence`
  — a red naming the consumer's lexer — with an expected-vs-got in which both sides render
  `FTok(NaN)`. Two things that look the same, and a verdict about the wrong thing. 38 corpus
  queries in one downstream reached it.

  The obligation is unchanged and is the caller's: `run_partial`'s documentation has said since
  0.10.0 that such a type must hand-write the impl that says what equality means for it, and value
  equality is deliberate. What moves is the **diagnosis**. Every comparison any tier draws a
  verdict from now answers with the **component that decided it** rather than with a `bool`, and
  asks, once it has already failed, whether *that* operation is equal to itself; a side whose is
  not gets a refusal tagged `non-reflexive-payload` naming the component — the token payload, the
  error payload, the `Kind`, the `L::State`, the span, the slice — and the obligation.

  **The refusal is asked about the comparison that ran, and about nothing else.** The first draft
  of this repair answered `bool` and then scanned the whole item for a non-reflexive value, which
  is a different question: the scan runs afterwards and knows nothing about *why*. So a divergence
  settled at the **discriminant** — an item that is a lexer error on the truncated buffer and a
  committed token on the full one, where no caller equality is consulted at all — still turned up
  a `NaN` in the payload beside it and was refused, and the refusal said the kit had convicted the
  lexer of nothing. It had: that is precisely the truncation nonconformance the partial tier
  exists to report, and the panic one line below says so. The fix for a false red had produced a
  false green. A difference at the discriminant or in item **count** is now terminal, because
  neither consults a caller equality at all. A component bounded to a *total* equality is terminal
  too whenever its own comparison is sound, which is every case a kept `Eq` promise produces — and
  the entry below is what the kit does when the promise is not kept.

  **And no site collapses those comparisons into a `bool` before deciding.** That rule was applied
  inside each comparison and not to the composition above them, and the cache kit's prefilled
  purity law is composed: it compares the prefix `peek` was handed *and* the run `peek` appended
  behind that prefix. `||` over the two answers a `bool` that does not record which half fired, so
  the failure path re-ran both refusals — and the half that decided nothing was probed too. A
  prefix impurity settled by a span or by a length says nothing, and a `NaN` the second peek
  fabricated in the *appended* run then withheld a verdict the kit had established. That is the
  same `bool` one level up. The comparison now answers which half failed to reproduce, that half's
  two runs and what decided them — a **length** included, which an `Option<(position, component)>`
  could not distinguish from agreement — and the branch condition and the failure path consume
  that one result. The four purity sites take the same shape, so no `!=` over two peeked runs is
  left in the kit to compose.

  The failure names the half, and that is the one thing it can no longer say: it prints the
  deciding half's two runs where it used to print both pairs. A cache impure in *both* halves is
  reported at the prefix and its appended defect is seen on the next run — the same cost
  "span first, always" already pays at the entry comparison, and for the same reason.

  **The sweep is the population and not the reported site.** Six comparisons: `assert_run_eq` and
  `check_resume` in the trait tier, `assert_partial_stream_eq` and `assert_partial_prefix_of` in
  the partial tier, the committed-stream comparison in the integration tier, and the cache kit's
  entry and purity comparisons, whose observable is the `(span, token, state)` triple and which
  asks `PartialEq` of two of the three. A guard at one and not the others is the same defect one
  relocation away — and so is a component-aware rule at one and a whole-item scan at another, so
  all of them decide from what failed at that site. `Token::Kind` is bounded `Eq`, `Lexer::Span`
  is bounded `Ord` and `Source::Slice` is bounded `Eq`, so a refusal drawn from any of those three
  is a broken *total*-equality promise rather than a partial one; each still gets a probe when it
  is the component that decided, because a component that can decide a verdict and cannot be
  refused is a component whose failure is reported as a defect of the thing under test.

  **It can only ever re-label a failure, never create one.** Every guard sits on a path its own
  comparison has already taken to failure, so a reflexive value never reaches one. That is what
  keeps the repair from trading a false red for a false green, and it is pinned by two controls
  that pull in opposite directions: a genuinely non-conforming lexer over the same float payload
  type, never `NaN`, still reds `partial-equivalence` with two distinguishable values in the
  message; and a `NaN` payload that is what decided its comparison is still refused. The
  discriminant counterexample is a third: the same truncation defect with a `NaN` error payload
  and with a reflexive one now report identically.

- **A borrowed token keeps its punctuation and pratt capabilities** (#268). `Token`,
  `IdentifierToken`, `KeywordToken` and every `LitToken` predicate forward from `T` to `&'a T`;
  `PunctuatorToken` and `PrattToken` did not, so a lexer or adapter whose token type is `&T`
  passed the base bound and four capability bounds and then failed to compile on punctuation or
  on token-level pratt, for the same semantic token. Both forwarding impls are added.

  **The punctuation impl is generated from the same arm sequence that generates the trait.** Every
  constructor there defaults to `None`, so a hand-maintained forwarding list compiles while
  silently answering `None` for whatever arm it dropped — the same defect with the compile error
  removed. `PunctuatorTokenExt` and `SpannedPunctuatorToken` are blanket impls over
  `T: PunctuatorToken` and follow from it with no new impl of their own.

  **The pratt impl stays generic in `Expr` and `Power`.** A token type may classify for more than
  one expression family, and an impl pinned to the `i64` default would carry one of those
  classifications across the borrow while the base `Token` impl carried the whole token.

  `FromLogos` is the one member of the family with no reference impl and cannot have one: it
  constructs (`fn from_logos(Self::Logos) -> Self`), and a `&'a T` cannot be built from an owned
  logos token.

- **`From<Keyword> for Ident` carries the recovery status instead of fabricating `Valid`**
  (#301). `Keyword::<&str>::missing(span).into()` produced an `Ident` reporting `is_valid()`,
  and an `IdentList` containing that segment then reported itself valid as a whole. The
  conversion was documented as unfixable at the call site because the information did not exist
  on the source side; it does now, and it crosses unchanged. `Keyword::map` carries it too, for
  the reason `Ident::map` does — mapping `&str` to `String` changes how a spelling is stored,
  not whether there was one.

  **Two behaviours change with no diagnostic.** `Keyword::error(span)` no longer compares equal
  to `Keyword::new(span, "<error>")`, and hashes differently, because the status is part of the
  value; and the eighteen carriers grow one field, so `Keyword<&str, SimpleSpan>` goes from 32 to
  40 bytes — exactly `Ident<&str, SimpleSpan>`'s size, which already paid it.

- **`InvalidHexDigits`'s shared reader can no longer be turned into a truncating one by a method
  added later** (#280). The type's `Deref`, `DerefMut` and `bump` read `as_slices().0` /
  `as_mut_slices().0` — the first physical segment of a ring buffer handed out as the whole set,
  the shape #245 fixed in `IncompleteSyntax`. It was correct, because the only mutation was an
  append and so the head never left zero, but that was a property of the method list rather than
  of the type, and two of the three reads went through `Deref`/`DerefMut` and so did not name
  `as_slices` for a grep to find.

  The two reads whose receiver is exclusive now normalize instead of assuming: `make_contiguous`
  returns the whole ring by construction, whatever state it is in. The one that cannot — `Deref`
  takes `&self` by trait definition, and one `&[T]` cannot describe two segments — is backed by
  containment rather than by a comment: the struct is declared in a private submodule, so its
  field is unreachable from the rest of the file, and every mutation goes through one funnel that
  restores contiguity on exit, the unwinding one included. A `pop_front` added next year is a
  private-field error, not a silent reintroduction.

- **A green tree deep enough to abort in its own destructor can no longer be materialized**
  (#316). The construction half of an uncatchable process abort reachable from safe third-party
  code: `rowan`'s recursive release of a green tree. Both public construction doors are covered —
  the recording `Sink` (through `CstEmitter::cst_start`, `EmitterView::cst_start`, and the `Sink`
  re-export, all landing in `Cst::finish`/`finish_partial`) and `SyntaxTreeBuilder`, which has no
  sink behind it. Both refuse with `FinishError::TooDeep`; see **Added** for the ceiling and its
  derivation.

  **The refusal is charged on the frame stack `replay` already maintains, and deliberately not on
  the sink's own recorded depth.** Materialization *hoists* every retro-wrap to its target, so `n`
  same-target wraps open `n` nested frames while `Sink::depth` never exceeds one — and that is not
  an exotic shape, it is exactly what the Pratt CST hook emits for an `n`-operator expression. A
  ceiling charged at the recorded depth would have left the abort reachable through this crate's
  own blessed path; `same_target_wraps_nest_in_the_tree_while_the_recorded_depth_never_leaves_one`
  and `the_ceiling_catches_the_retro_wrap_shape_the_recorded_depth_cannot_see` hold the
  distinction. `finish_partial` refuses too: it tolerates incompleteness by closing open nodes,
  which for this stream would build the very tree that cannot be dropped.

  **What the suite cannot pin, stated rather than papered over:** that a tree past the ceiling
  really would abort. The witness would have to exist to be asserted about, and its existence is
  the hazard — the process dies in the drop glue of the value under test, with no unwind, so there
  is no `#[should_panic]` and no `catch_unwind` for it. The abort depth is established outside the
  suite by bisection and recorded beside the ceiling it derives; the cells hold the refusal, which
  is the half a test can hold.

- **The README feature table discloses `rowan 0.17.0`'s known upstream undefined behaviour**
  (#252). The `rowan` row advertised the lossless CST with no safety warning, while the record
  lived only in `tokora/Cargo.toml` comments and the Miri scripts. It now names both sites
  (Stacked Borrows at `arc.rs:264` from building any green tree, Tree Borrows at `cursor.rs:136`
  from dropping any red-tree `SyntaxNode`), states that tokora's own `src/cst` contains no
  `unsafe`, that the upstream issues are open since 2021 so raising the requirement is not an
  exit, and that both Miri matrices exclude the feature — which means zero coverage of the shipped
  lossless path rather than a green result. Disclosure only; #252's actual exit (fork, replace or
  withdraw) stays open.

- **`UnexpectedEnd::reconstruct`, `reconstruct_with_name`, and `reconstruct_without_name` no
  longer clear the terminal-stop flag or drop the expected set** (#300). All three rebuilt the
  value through the defaulting constructors `maybe_name_of` / `with_name_of` / `of`, each of
  which hardcodes `expected: None` and `terminal: false` — so reconstructing to give an error a
  new name and a transformed hint silently reset two fields the transformation never named.
  `map_hint`, the method immediately preceding them in the same impl block, does the identical
  job through a struct literal that carries `expected` and `terminal` across; the three that
  followed it did not.

  `terminal` is the sharp half: it marks a **terminal scanner stop** — a resource-limit trip, or
  the poison boundary that latches it — rather than a genuine end of input, and recovery keys off
  `MaybeTerminal` to re-raise the stop instead of spending it. A consumer that reconstructed such
  an error before handing it on got back a value whose `is_terminal()` answered `false`, turning
  a must-not-recover stop into an ordinary recoverable end-of-input. Dropping `expected` is a
  diagnostics regression rather than a control-flow one: the reconstructed error lost the
  end-of-input expected set `maybe_expected_of` had attached.

  All three now use `map_hint`'s struct-literal shape: `offset`, `expected`, and `terminal`
  carry through unchanged, and only what each method's own contract names is reset —
  `reconstruct` and `reconstruct_with_name` take the new name, `reconstruct_without_name` clears
  it. `reconstruct*` has no callers in `tokora/src`; the witness is a legal safe public call
  sequence — a consumer that receives a terminal `UnexpectedEnd` this crate produced and
  reconstructs it — the same standing as #265 and #266, which is why the severity is P2 and not
  higher. Found by the census for #266, the same mechanism — rebuild through a constructor that
  defaults a private field — with a different payload.

- **`PARSE_DEFAULT_DEPTH` is derived from a five-axis measurement of a door that spends none of it,
  and the door it *is* enforced on has now been measured** (#297). `measured::CONSUMER_ABORTS_AT`
  was documented as "a real consumer grammar's debug build aborts at this depth […] on the tightest
  of its five measured axes". Those five axes vary architecture, dialect, shape and source backing
  — and hold fixed, without saying so, that every reading is of that consumer's **syntactic** door,
  which takes no `InputRef::descend` and therefore spends no level of this budget at all.

  Cross-checked three ways and then at runtime. A sweep of the consumer's syntactic tree finds no
  `descend`/`descending` call; `RecursionLimitReached` has exactly **one** construction site in this
  crate (`InputRef::descend`); that site's only in-crate callers are the two Pratt engines
  (`InputRef::pratt`, `parser::pratt::expr`), which the consumer does not use. Directly: under the
  shipped budget of 16, with the consumer's own lexer tally lifted, its syntactic door parses 64
  nested braces clean while its lossless door refuses at exactly 16.

  **The re-measurement.** Same method as the original — one parse per *process*, on an explicitly
  sized 2 MiB thread, greatest depth that returns before the next aborts — pointed at the lossless
  door, with the boundary converted into *descents* (the unit `RecursionLimiter::limitation` is
  compared against) by an in-process oracle: the smallest ceiling under which the same document
  parses clean. `aarch64-apple-darwin`, rustc 1.99.0-nightly (771916f90). Debug, last descent count
  that returns: GraphQL inline fragments **717**, GraphQLx inline fragments **715**, GraphQLx
  generic angle brackets **843**, GraphQL recovery bypass **669**, GraphQLx recovery bypass with
  `)` and with `>` alike **667**, object-value cycle **875**, list-value cycle **1294**; x86_64
  moves the first cell to 805, so aarch64 stays the binding architecture. The syntactic row's fifth
  axis — a `bytes::Bytes` source backing — has **no lossless counterpart**: all twelve of that
  consumer's lossless entry points take `&str`.

  **The release table, which had never been taken, is the same instrument run twice.** Release,
  aarch64: 4238 / 3861 / **3282** / 5472 / 4863 / 3455 / 3455 in the same order. Optimisation
  reorders which shape binds — the generic angle brackets are the loosest debug cell and the
  tightest release one — so a release figure extrapolated from debug's ratio would have named the
  wrong shape as well as the wrong number.

  **What the shipped formula makes of it**, unchanged, with `MIN_HEADROOM` and `MIN_MARGIN_TENTHS`
  untouched: **128** debug (`128 × 3 = 384 < 667`, `256 × 3 = 768` is not) and **1024** release.
  Both are published as `policy::PARSE_DEFAULT_DEBUG_ON_THE_LOSSLESS_ROW` and its release twin,
  derived from the measured rows, pinned by the same two-halved assertion the shipped cells get and
  by a literal from outside the derivation — **and read by nothing.**

  **`PARSE_DEFAULT_DEPTH` is unchanged at 16, deliberately.** The mis-pointing errs in the
  recoverable direction — the wrong row is the tighter one, so the cost is depth rather than an
  abort — and repointing is one decision that moves four other things: an 8× loosening of a shipped
  safety default and a behaviour break; `TOKORA_ABORTS_AT > CONSUMER_…_ABORTS_AT`, whose intent
  ("the consumer row is the binding one") is an artefact of the syntactic door and inverts
  legitimately on the lossless one; the release arm, which can then be derived rather than floored,
  making the two arms diverge and the `debug_assertions`-as-profile-proxy caveat live for the first
  time; and the provisional release assertion, which prices the release budget at the *debug*
  per-level cost and must be re-priced or a 1024-level release budget "fits" a 2 MiB thread it does
  not fit. Each of those is now a compiled relation rather than a paragraph.

  What it costs today is measured rather than argued: over 472 shipped fixtures, that consumer's
  deepest spends **11** descents, an ordinary filter query reaches 10 or 11, and
  `f(where: {a: {b: [1]}})` spends **5** for what reads as three-deep because an argument list's
  `(` is a one-off toll. So 16 leaves 1.45× over documents that already exist, under the 2× floor
  that same consumer enforces on its own nesting ceiling at compile time — which it escapes only
  because the binding number is tokora's.

  No public API moved. `measured::CONSUMER_ABORTS_AT` and `CONSUMER_BYTES_PER_LEVEL` are
  `pub(crate)` and are renamed `CONSUMER_SYNTACTIC_ABORTS_AT` / `CONSUMER_SYNTACTIC_BYTES_PER_LEVEL`
  — a bare "consumer" figure is exactly the name that got read as describing the door the budget is
  enforced on. The syntactic row keeps the two jobs it is still the right row for: pricing
  `native_stack::RED_ZONE` and `SEGMENTED_PRATT_DEPTH`, both of which are about the *heaviest* frame
  and would silently drop by 13× and rise by 16× respectively if the repoint had been done by
  moving one constant.
- **`Verbose` recorded and rewound through two `BTreeMap`s that unwinding caller code could leave
  disagreeing — twice over a map descent that had not finished, and once over a value the rollback
  destroyed on the spot** (#249, #254). A `BTreeMap` insertion is two operations, not one: `entry`
  searches — which is the only part that runs the caller's `S: Ord` — and `or_default` then fills
  the handle without comparing again. Both write paths fused them, so the *first* map was already
  mutated when the second descent ran, and a span type whose comparison unwinds tore the pair
  apart.

  On the record side (#249) the residue was an **empty label group under a span key the payload
  map does not have**, published through `Verbose::labels`, unreachable by `rewind` because no log
  entry names it, and left in place by the rewind the previous matrix ran as part of its
  assertion. Measured over the error, warning and skipped-region channels alike, arming the second
  descent: `labels={…, BombSpan(25): [], …}` against a payload map still holding four keys. The
  record path documented itself as leaving "no payload, no label entry and no log entry" two lines
  above conceding that this residue "is publicly visible"; the code now meets the contract instead
  of the contract retreating to the code.

  On the rollback side (#254) `rewind_to` popped the log entry **first** and then ran two to four
  further descents, each of which could unwind after the mark had already moved. The residues were
  a sheared emitter that no later call repairs — `mark=0` with both maps still full, or a payload
  group removed while its label group survived — and the shape differed between profiles, because
  two of the six comparisons were `debug_assert` lookups that release does not run (six armable
  comparisons in debug against four in release for a group that empties; four against two for one
  that does not). Popping the log *last* around map work that is still fallible would have been
  **worse**, not better: it leaves the log naming a slot the payload group no longer has, and
  `Diagnostics` indexes by that slot. What makes the ordering safe is that the fallible half is
  hoisted out of it.

  **And hoisting the descents did not make the rest of the rollback infallible.** Taking both
  handles first removes every comparison and every clone from the commit, but a commit that
  *destroys* what it removes still runs caller code, because a generic parameter is the caller's
  type in every position it appears and destruction is one of those positions. Discarding what
  `Vec::pop` returns runs `Error::drop` after the payload group has been shortened and before the
  label group has; `btree_map::OccupiedEntry::remove` runs `S::drop` on the key it throws away,
  after one map has lost the span and before its twin has. Either leaves the log naming a slot or
  a key that is no longer there, and `Diagnostics` indexes by exactly that — the corruption the
  descent ordering was fixed to prevent, reached through the one kind of caller code the census
  had not listed, because the commit had been *defined* as infallible and then not re-derived.
  Swept across three channels, three rollback shapes and both record shapes, **38 of the 107
  armed destructor positions corrupted the channel and 0 of the 216 comparison and clone
  positions did** — the two emptied-group key removals on every channel including the
  payload-less skipped-region one, and the payload destructor on the error and warning channels.
  The destructor positions that stay clean are clean for a reason and are pinned as such rather
  than fixed: the two `S::drop`s that `BTreeMap::entry` runs on a key it did not need to store
  are above the commit point, and the `S::drop` from popping the log entry is below it.

  Both paths now take **every** map handle before they mutate anything, and the rollback **moves
  rather than destroys**: `pop_group` hands back the popped element and the whole removed entry
  (`remove_entry`, not `remove`, so the key returns instead of being dropped), the popped
  `LogEntry` joins them, and all of it is released only once both maps and the log name the same
  emissions again. The commit therefore runs no caller code whatsoever — no comparison, no clone,
  no destructor. The release is **per unwound entry, not per call**: a rollback that collected a
  whole suffix would satisfy every state assertion while moving its destructors into a later
  entry's unwind, where a panic is a second panic. A caught panic now leaves a record with
  nothing written, and a rollback with the entry either untouched (a comparison or clone) or
  completely unwound (a destructor); a retried `rewind` still reaches the clean result. The
  rollback resolves its handles through owned keys, so `Store::rewind_to` gains `S: Clone`
  (already required by the `Emitter` impl, so no public bound moves) and spends two descents per
  unwound entry rather than two-to-four, dropping the two debug-only lookups as well — which is
  also why the residue no longer differs by profile: with no `debug_assert` lookup left on the
  path, the sweep measures identical call counts and identical verdicts in debug and release.

  **The matrix is a sweep now, not a sample, and its axes are what the code does to a caller
  value rather than what has already gone wrong.** The previous one armed a single hand-picked
  comparison and then read only `payload_len` — it never looked at the map the failed operation
  had actually mutated. Each cell now measures how many `S::Ord`, `S::Clone`, `S::drop` and
  `Error::drop` calls its path makes and arms each of them in turn, comparing both maps, the mark
  and the replay against what they were:
  `record_{,warning_,hole_}is_atomic_under_a_panicking_{ord,span_clone}` and
  `record_is_atomic_under_a_panicking_span_drop` over a fresh span and an existing one, and
  `rewind_{,warning_,hole_}is_atomic_under_a_panicking_ord`,
  `rewind_is_atomic_under_a_panicking_span_clone`, `rewind_is_atomic_under_a_panicking_span_drop`
  and `rewind_is_atomic_under_a_panicking_payload_drop` over three rollback shapes — a group that
  empties, a group that only shortens, and a multi-entry suffix where a panic can land after
  earlier entries have already committed. Two things a state oracle cannot see get their own
  cells. `the_cells_with_no_caller_destructor_have_none` pins at zero the paths that genuinely
  destroy nothing — a record over a fresh span, a record's payload on any shape, the hole
  channel's non-existent `Error` — so that "this cell measures nothing" stops being
  indistinguishable from "this cell measures a property", which is how the destructor axis went
  missing in the first place. And `an_escaping_panic_destroys_no_payload_on_the_way_out` pins the
  *timing* of the release: the payload-destructor count sampled when a panic is raised must
  already equal the count when it is caught, which is false for exactly the collected-suffix
  shape and true for nothing else the state assertions distinguish.

  **What is not fixed, and cannot be by ordering.** `Emitter::rewind` may run from a guard's
  `Drop` while a panic is already unwinding, where a second panic aborts the process, and it is
  reachable for `Verbose` (`ScanScope::drop` → `on_incomplete` → `InputRef::restore_entry`).
  Atomicity is not totality: a rollback that descends a map keyed by a caller-supplied `S` and
  destroys values the caller owns runs caller code no matter how it is ordered. Running none of
  it would take both a group identifier the log carries instead of the span, and somewhere
  outside the rollback to hand the removed values to — a `rewind` that returns `()` has nowhere.
  This round does not move that boundary: caller destructors could already escape `rewind_to`
  before it, they merely corrupted the channel on the way out. `Emitter::rewind`'s clause claimed
  all built-in emitters were structurally non-panicking there — true of `Fatal`, `Silent` and
  `Ignored`, whose rollbacks are empty, and never true of `Verbose` — and now says so, naming all
  four kinds of caller code, as does `Verbose::rewind`'s own documentation. Every span and error
  type this crate ships, and any user type whose `Ord`, `Clone` and `Drop` are total, is
  unaffected.

- **An at-limit refusal on a *second* entry could be decided and then not recorded, and the
  analysis that was supposed to have found it looked at the wrong set of sites.** Once the one-shot
  probe is spent, the input carries a **recorded** decision that it already refused an item — a
  durable cell no rollback and no state re-key can clear. The poison boundary that short-circuits
  the next entry is not durable: a rollback copies the saved one back, a `set_state` drops it. With
  the boundary cleared, `settle_met_ceiling` was re-entered in a state where a refusal was the only
  possible outcome, and it then ran four consumer steps in front of the publication that outcome
  obliged — `Source::len`, the `Offset::Ord` against it, **the destructor of the owned offset `len`
  hands back**, and the whole boundary derivation. An unwind in any of them, caught inside an
  `attempt` whose baseline follows the first refusal, left that attempt reading no new trip and an
  unpoisoned input. Measured over `"ab cd ef gh"` at a ceiling of `2`, with the stop re-opened by a
  declining `attempt`: **`(2 of 4 items reported Ok, probe spent, 0 trips, not poisoned)`** on the
  committing exit — a successful parse over truncated input — and the same by `set_state`
  (`a_second_entry_publishes_at_every_offset_destructor`, and its `..._offset_clone_...` sibling
  for the derivation).

  The already-spent entry is now a **publisher in its own right**, tested first and answering off a
  `bool` on a crate-owned struct, so its decision costs no consumer code at all. Its witness — the
  trip count, the half outside the rollback set — is published before any `Source`, `Cache`, `Span`
  or `Offset` call and before any destructor; the boundary follows, because deriving one *is* four
  consumer steps and no ordering makes them infallible, and losing that memo costs a short-circuit
  the next entry re-establishes rather than the parse its terminality. `publish_scanner_trip`
  gained two named halves (`count_scanner_trip`, `install_scanner_boundary`) so that order is
  expressible while `Input::scanner_trips` keeps exactly one writer and `StagedTrip::install`
  exactly one caller.

  **The criterion was the defect.** R25's enumeration — every MIR `drop` terminator in the
  publication region, classified by whether a durable write **post-dominates** it — is exact about
  the sites it examines and wrong about *which* sites it examines: whole-body post-dominance
  quantifies over every path through a body, so a site is excluded the moment any path reaches an
  exit without writing. On the already-spent path no such exit exists, and the twenty-three sites
  it counted were classified as though it did. Re-derived under **path-conditioned** dominance —
  the same census, run separately with the `limit_probe_spent` switch pruned to each arm — the
  counts are `0` in class under `probe unspent`, `0` under the unconditioned reading it replaces,
  and **1 destruction site plus 3 consumer calls** under `probe spent`. All four are the ones
  repaired here; the same census over the repaired tree reads `0` under every condition.
  `REFUSAL_CENSUS` now polices the whole region above the already-spent count rather than a window
  between two points, and `TRIP_CENSUS` derives its publisher set from two needles instead of one.

  **The residual that disclosure named is closed, in the place it said it would have to be.** Two
  `L::Offset::clone`s still ran in front of the publication on that path, and they were in the
  *driver*, not the settle: `Resume`'s own position clone in `resume_from`, and the scan's `lex_at`
  local in `scan_with`. Both happen before `lex_within_boundary` is entered, so no ordering inside
  the lexing site could reach them — closing them needed the driver to answer *"has this input
  already refused?"* before it builds a lexer, which is a change to **where** the refusal is
  published rather than to the order in which it is.

  That answer is now asked at **all eleven** lexing drivers, by `InputRef::refusal_already_on_record`,
  and it costs nothing to ask: `TokenBudget` is an `InputRef` field, so the durable half of a
  refusal is a `bool` on a crate-owned struct readable at every driver entry. Its three conjuncts
  are the probe bit, the ceiling, and `poison_boundary` being `None` — and the third is what keeps
  this a change of ordering rather than of model. With no boundary latched, `reached_boundary` is
  false at every offset, so the entry is provably headed for the lexing site and provably reaches
  the same publication there; with one latched, the positional check decides and an input already
  stopped at its boundary keeps returning its stop **without a trip being counted a second time**
  (`a_latched_boundary_answers_without_counting_a_second_trip`). On the already-spent path the
  entry now builds no `Resume`, enters no scan, and reaches `settle_met_ceiling` not at all: the
  steps the sweeps used to walk are not re-ordered but gone, which is what those cells now pin as
  counts — `L::Offset::drop` `2 → 0`, `L::Offset::clone` `3 → 1`, the one survivor being the
  boundary memo's own, derived after the count. `RESUME_CENSUS` checks the gate's call count
  against the `Resume::parts_mut` count file by file, so a twelfth driver cannot arrive without it.

  **What remains, named rather than implied.** One consumer step is still ahead of the publication
  and cannot move: the driver's **front-drain** (`Cache::pop_front`, or `Cache::is_empty` /
  `Cache::len` for the probing forms). A driver has to know whether a token is already waiting
  before it can conclude anything about lexing one. A panic there on an already-refused entry,
  caught inside an `attempt` and concluded on without re-entering the scanner, still reports
  `(2 of 4 items reported Ok, 0 trips in the window, not poisoned)` — measured, and pinned as the
  residue by `the_front_drain_is_the_residue_and_the_budget_accessor_is_its_only_witness`. Also
  outside the gate: an entry whose boundary is latched but **not yet reached**, which is still owed
  a refusal and still reaches it through the prologue; no route in the tree was found that produces
  one, since every publication installs the boundary at the lex position it is standing on. Both
  are now *detectable* rather than silent — see `TokenBudgetTally::refused_an_item` under **Added**.

- **`CacheHarness::run` hung on a lexer that only returns errors — the same shape one tier over.**
  The corpus builder fills while `out.len() < want`, and that gate counts the tokens it *kept*
  while the loop consumes the whole item stream. An `Err` grows neither the corpus nor the lexer's
  exhaustion, so such a lexer never reaches `want` and never returns `None`, and the kit spun. The
  loop now counts **attempts** and refuses at a ceiling. Found by enumerating every counter in the
  conformance module against the question "can the loop iterate underneath it?", which is the
  question the `run_partial` budget below failed.

  The ceiling itself needed a second repair. It was described as derived — "monotone progress and
  nonempty spans bound a conforming lexer at one item per source unit" — and the contract enforced
  elsewhere says no such thing: starts must be *non-decreasing* rather than strictly increasing and
  spans *individually* nonempty rather than disjoint, so overlapping and repeated-start items are
  legal and a deterministic, finite, terminating lexer may emit many items per unit. This kit
  checks none of that in any case; it drives the raw lexer and never runs the lexer-contract tier.
  A lexer that merely emitted densely was therefore refused as non-terminating with no override
  available, so a cache certification against it could not be run at all. See
  `CacheHarness::lex_attempts_multiple` under **Added**.

  And the override then reopened the hang. Both anti-hang multiples — the one above and
  `Harness::budget_multiple` — were combined with the source length by **saturating** arithmetic, so
  `lex_attempts_multiple(usize::MAX)` produced a ceiling of `usize::MAX`, and no counter can exceed
  the largest value it can hold. Every `attempts > limit` and `spent > limit` derived from such a
  setting was false forever: the endless-error lexer these guards exist to refuse ran until the
  process was killed, reporting nothing on the way, and the counter's own overflow is 2⁶⁴ increments
  away in either profile. A knob documenting no maximum could therefore switch off the guard it
  configures, silently. Both multiples are now capped at `65536` per source unit — the point past
  which the kit cannot tell a dense lexer from a nonterminating one, which is the honest limit of
  what it certifies — and both ceilings are computed with checked arithmetic, so the *product*
  cannot saturate on a 32-bit target either; an unrepresentable ceiling panics and names the knob
  to lower instead of switching itself off. The cap is a **refusal** rather than a clamp, for
  reasons set out under the `run_partial` entry below, and each knob is pinned by a cell that
  drives an endless lexer at the maximum *accepted* setting and requires the `lex-budget` refusal
  to still arrive.

- **`Harness::run_partial` hung, rather than refusing, on a lexer that never terminates — its
  anti-hang budget was checked at the `next()` boundary and `next()` is a loop.** `InputRef::next`
  keeps lexing after every lexer error it accepts until it finds a token or reaches end of input,
  so a budget read once per call bounds the items a drain *yields* and says nothing about how often
  the lexer is asked to lex. The two come apart on exactly the malformed lexer the kit exists to
  reject: a lexer returning the same nonempty error forever is reported **once** — the input
  layer's error dedup keys on the span end — and then silently skipped, so the item log stays flat
  while the call never returns. `run_partial` spun instead of panicking, on the lexer that most
  needed the panic.

  Both drains — and every schedule in the integration tier, which had the identical shape — now
  run the lexer under a wrapper that counts **every raw `Lexer::lex` attempt**, and the count is
  **one counter per tier per input**, not one per call and not one per lexer.

  That last distinction is the whole repair, and it took one attempt to get wrong. Putting the
  counter on the lexer instance looks like putting it "inside `next()`", since the input layer runs
  one call's whole internal loop on one instance — but the layer builds a **fresh lexer for every
  `next()`** (`Lexer::with_state` plus `bump`), so a per-instance counter is a per-call counter and
  restarts on every call. A lexer that spends the whole per-call ceiling on repeated same-span
  errors and then yields one advancing token stays inside every guard: the span-end dedup keeps the
  repeats out of the item log so the item budget stays flat, and each call gets a new instance. Run
  over every prefix by `run_partial`, raw lex work is then cubic in the source length — 1319
  attempts over 4 units rising to 66779 over 24, a fit to `8n³/3 + Θ(n²)` — with neither guard
  firing and no hang to notice.

  So the rule is stated rather than the guard moved again: **a budget bounds only the loops that
  increment it.** Where the kit lexes directly the counter sits in the loop body and bounds it by
  construction; where it lexes through the input layer it owns the outermost loops and the
  innermost call and none of the ones between, so the counter belongs at the tier entry. Every
  prefix, schedule, drain, `next`/`peek` call, lexer instance and checkpoint lineage beneath one
  input charges the same one. That boundary is the last one available: the only loop above it
  iterates the caller's own input list, which is data rather than lexer behaviour.

  **The counter cannot be refunded, and that is enforced rather than asserted.** It is a `Cell` in
  a private submodule, so it has exactly one reachable writer and a refund written from outside is
  a compile error; the handle that reaches each rebuilt lexer is an `Rc` riding in the lexer state,
  so a checkpoint restore puts back a pointer to the one count rather than a copy of it. A tally
  kept as a field of the thing being rolled back is handed back by the rollback and is not a budget
  at all. `Lexer::new` has no channel for a tally and does not invent one — it builds an
  already-spent one, so an unseeded drive refuses on its first attempt instead of running
  unbounded.

  The per-instance ceiling stays, demoted to what it is: an early refusal that stops a single
  non-returning `next()` after `O(units)` attempts rather than the tally's `O(units²)`. A guard may
  be narrower than the bound; it may not *be* the bound while a loop underneath it resets it.

  It also may not *contradict* the bound, which the first version of it did in both directions. It
  was `8 * units + 64` computed from whichever source the instance had been handed, so it never saw
  `Harness::budget_multiple` — a lexer certified under a raised budget met the default anyway — and
  in the partial tier the source is a **prefix**, so the ceiling shrank as the cut moved in while
  the run it bounded did not. Either way the outcome was a conforming lexer *rejected*, which is
  the one failure a narrower guard may not produce: the sharper message it exists to give is worth
  nothing if it is a lie. The ceiling is now derived once from the tier's configured budget — one
  attempt for every item that budget allows, plus the exhaustion probe — and carried on the tally
  beside the count, so every instance under one tier holds the same one and it is a number the item
  budget already permits. A scan produces at most the items left in the run, so a lexer the item
  budget accepts cannot reach it.

  The aggregate ceiling is `drains * 4 * (budget + 1) + 64` and is deliberately loose: a lexer
  evading it needs work that outgrows it, so any constant serves, while a tight ceiling would
  falsely refuse a legitimate lexer, which no constant repairs. Measured across the whole in-tree
  suite the tightest headroom is 42.8x.

  **Both counters compare before they increment**, which is what keeps that looseness safe. While
  the aggregate ceiling was a `usize` it *saturated*, and a saturated `usize::MAX` made
  `spent += 1; spent > limit` overflow before it ever compared — debug panicked with the wrong
  message, release wrapped the tally to zero and handed the run its whole allowance again,
  silently, as often as the work asked. `spent >= limit` asked first, with the increment only on
  the allowed path, makes the arithmetic total without moving any lexer's verdict — `limit`
  attempts still pass and the `limit + 1`-th still refuses. `instance_ceiling(budget)` is
  `budget + 1` over a budget that may be `usize::MAX - 1`, so the per-instance counter had the same
  defect and takes the same order.

  **The aggregate ceiling and the tally count in `u128`, not in the host's `usize`.** The formula
  is quadratic in the source — `run_partial` drives every split point, so `drains` is `units + 3` —
  while a `usize` is not, and in `usize` it saturated at 11,580 units at the default multiple and
  127 at the maximum on a 32-bit target. The tally then stopped being a bound derived from the
  source and became a flat `usize::MAX` cap, flat while the formula it replaced kept growing: about
  75× short at 100,000 units.

  That cap was reachable by an **ordinary lexer over an ordinary source**, which is what made it a
  defect and not a recorded cost. A conforming `WithinSpan` lexer emitting one item per byte spends
  about one attempt per item, and the partial sweep drives it over every split of the source: over
  100 KB that is on the order of five billion prefix attempts, already past `usize::MAX` at 32 bits
  before the two full-input drains are counted. Such a lexer passed at 64 bits and took an ordinary
  `lex-budget` refusal at 32 — the kit reporting its own arithmetic as the lexer's fault — and
  `budget_multiple` could not help, because every permitted setting collapses to the same cap. The
  ceiling is now the same number at every target width, and the 32-bit refusal is gone rather than
  raised.

  **A ceiling the kit runs out of is reported as the kit's limit, under its own tag.** `u128` is
  still finite, so the derivation is *checked* and records the one case it does not fit —
  exactly, rather than inferred from a saturated value. Exhausting that ceiling panics under
  `kit-capacity` rather than `lex-budget` and says INCONCLUSIVE and *not a verdict on the lexer*,
  because the truth there is that the counter ran out and nothing was decided about the lexer
  either way. Reaching it needs about 2⁵⁵ source units, and it is distinguished anyway: a caller
  who does arrive must be told the right thing. `CacheHarness`'s unrepresentable-ceiling panic
  takes the same tag for the same reason — it fires before the lexer is asked to lex once.

  **`Harness::budget_multiple` and `CacheHarness::lex_attempts_multiple` now panic above 65536
  rather than clamping to it.** The cap is unchanged and still necessary — a multiple of
  `usize::MAX` computes a ceiling of `usize::MAX`, which the comparison reaches only after
  `usize::MAX` attempts, so the guard the knob configures never arrives in a run anybody waits out
  — but a clamp enforced it by *silently lowering the caller's budget*. The lexer contract permits
  finite density above the cap, so the clamp had a reachable victim: on a one-unit source a
  requested multiple of 65,601 should allow 65,665 items, the clamp allowed 65,600, and a legal
  lexer emitting 65,601 errors and then `None` was refused on its exhaustion probe by `run_partial`
  while `run` reported it as possibly nonterminating. That is the same conforming-lexer-rejected
  outcome as above, reached from a setting the builder accepted without a word — and a caller reads
  the `lex-budget` tag as a verdict on their lexer. Above the cap this kit cannot tell a dense lexer
  from a nonterminating one, and it now says so at the call site, naming the knob and the maximum.
  Below `1` both still adjust silently: that direction only widens the budget, and a wider budget
  cannot manufacture a failure.

  The integration tier's guards were the same defect and had not fired: the trait-tier checks that
  run before it happen to reject a non-terminating lexer first. That is an argument about check
  order, not a bound, so they are wrapped too. The same wrapper is also what now bounds a
  zero-width-span lexer in a **release** build of a downstream's test suite: the input layer's
  nonempty-span check is a `debug_assert!`, so before this the only thing standing between a
  zero-width span and a spinning scanner was the per-`next()` budget this replaces.

- **`IncompleteSyntax::as_slice` no longer stops at the ring boundary** (#245). The components
  live in a `ArrayDeque`, and a deque is not one physical slice: `push_front` moves the
  head off zero, after which `as_slices()` has two segments. The accessor returned the first
  one. So a two-component error built as `new(B)` then `push_front(A)` reported `len() == 2`,
  iterated `A, B`, and handed `AsRef` and `Display` only `[A]` — and because `Display` branches
  its grammar on the slice's length, the message also changed to the singular *"component A is
  missing"*. Parse diagnostics silently lost expected alternatives, and which ones depended on
  the ring's internal head position rather than on the value.

  **A `&self` accessor cannot fix this where it is read.** Making a wrapped ring contiguous
  needs `&mut`, and `AsRef::as_ref`'s receiver is fixed by the trait, so the choice was to
  normalize at *insertion* time or to give the shared slice view up. The two `try_push_*_impl`
  doors are the only way an element enters, and both now leave the ring in one physical
  segment; `as_slice` reads that with a `debug_assert` at the one site a future insertion path
  that skipped it would silently truncate. `Display` is a consumer of the accessor and needed
  no change of its own — it follows, grammar included. Cost to a caller: none at the API
  level; a wrapping `push_front` pays one rotation of a buffer whose capacity is the syntax's
  compile-time component count.

- **`Cst::finish` no longer describes an incomplete handle as resumable** (#248). Its
  abort-semantics note said an `Incomplete` parse should *"keep the handle — the buffered events
  are the resumable state"*. No such capability exists: the handle's whole public surface is
  `resource_trips`, `with_trivia_policy`, `trivia_policy`, `error_kind`, `gap_kind`,
  `inner_ref`, `finish` and `finish_partial`, and not one of them accepts a buffer, resumes the
  lexer, or writes another event into the sink. The contradiction was inside the crate's own
  docs — `parse_lossless_partial` says to drop the handle and drive again over the larger slice
  at Θ(Σ attempt lengths) — so a reader had two opposed continuation models and only the second
  matched the API. It was not one sentence either: the same claim was repeated in guide chapter
  16 and in a test comment, and all three now agree.

  The sentence is corrected rather than the capability built, and deliberately. Resuming a
  recording sink across redrives corrupts its event log; that is why `Sink` does not implement
  `ValueKeyedEmitter` and cannot be paired with `PartialSession::parse`, so the promised
  operation is one the type system refuses on purpose rather than one that was left out. A
  bounded CST retry needs its own session type owning the budget, the terminal latch and a
  fresh sink per attempt, which is al8n/tokora#251's subject. What the handle *is* for is now
  stated where the wrong claim was: inspecting the attempt (`resource_trips`, `inner_ref`) and
  opting into a truncated tree for tooling (`finish_partial`). The lifecycle is also executable
  now — a test drives two incomplete attempts, drops each handle, re-drives the enlarged slice
  and requires the resulting tree to equal the one-shot parse of the same bytes.

- **`error::incomplete_syntax`'s module header described an implementation that does not
  exist.** It advertised a choice between a const-generic and a type-level implementation,
  selected by a `generic-array` feature. The crate declares no such feature, the file carries no
  `cfg`, and `const COMPONENTS: usize` appears nowhere in it — there is one implementation.
  Found by sweeping the two modules #245/#246/#248 touch for the same defect shape.

- **`IncompleteSyntax::from_iter` reports the overflow its `Option` promises** (#246). The
  method documents `None` when the iterator yields more unique components than the buffer
  holds. It called `try_push_impl` for every component and discarded the result — and that
  result is precisely the overflow signal, `Some(component)` for a component that was new and
  did not fit. Each rejected component was dropped on the floor and `from_iter` returned `Some`
  over the surviving prefix, so a caller reading `Some` as *"every unique component is here"*
  was reading a guarantee nothing enforced, and which components survived depended on the
  iterator's order. It now refuses at the first component that overflows and stops advancing
  the iterator there. Duplicates are unaffected: they are absorbed by the same deduplication
  `push` uses and were never overflow, so `[A, A, B]` still fits a two-component syntax.

- **A `logos` error no longer suppresses a state-limit trip that landed on the same item.**
  `LogosLexer`'s "Limit-error latching" contract is that a limit error from `Lexer::check` is
  returned **once** after a scan and then latches, so an error-recovery loop over untrusted input
  cannot be made to scan past the configured limit. The post-scan check ran only on the
  `Some(Ok(token))` arm.

  A `logos` callback is free to mutate `extras` *and* return `Err` for the same matched item, and
  that item is a completed scan too — the tally moved. When both happened at once the raw `logos`
  error was forwarded with the state never consulted: `lex` kept answering `Some(Err(logos))` for
  every remaining match, `poisoned` was never set, and the scan count went on growing past the
  limit. All three supported `logos` majors shared the defect, because the adapter is one macro.

  The check now runs once, outside the `Ok`/`Err` split, and ranks the two: a tripped state
  outranks the raw `logos` error it arrived with, because the tally is monotone and no later input
  can clear it while a lexer error is a fact about one item. A raw `logos` error whose `check()` is
  still `Ok` is forwarded exactly as before, and the `None` arm is untouched.

  `InputRef` was never unbounded here — classification asks `check()` itself and records a poison
  boundary, so that path stayed latched — but it builds its trip verdict out of the error `lex`
  returned, so a trip that arrived wearing a `logos` error was latched correctly and **diagnosed
  wrongly**. Fixing the adapter fixes the payload on the complete and partial-frontier paths with
  no change at the input layer. Reported by an external audit at `7789dcd`.

- **`examples/json.rs` accepted lone surrogates, so the shipped JSON demonstration accepted
  invalid JSON.** The string rule spelled its unicode escape `u[a-fA-F0-9]{4}`, which admits the
  surrogate range `D800`–`DFFF`. RFC 8259 §7 admits a surrogate code unit only as the matching half
  of a high/low pair, so `"\uD800"`, `"\uDC00"` and `"\uD800A"` are not JSON and the example
  accepted all three. It is the example, not the library — but a lexer example's whole job is to be
  a correct model of the language it names, and this one was already being copied as a reference
  JSON lexer.

  Surrogate pairing is now spelled in the regex rather than validated in a callback, and the rule
  is split into `Token::String` (`" char* "`) and `Token::EscapedString` (`" char* esc
  (char|esc)* "`) — disjoint by construction, so the DFA needs no priority tie-break. Both report
  `TokenKind::String`, so the grammar and every diagnostic it raises are unchanged; what the split
  buys is the fact a consumer wants, which is whether the slice needs decoding before use.

  Measured over the bundled 107 KB `sample.json`, interleaved in one process against the rule as it
  shipped: a validating callback costs **1.65×**, the folded regex **1.02–1.07×**.

- **`tinyvec::SliceVec` no longer panics when the input outgrows its backing slice** (#263). The
  adapter called the panicking upstream `SliceVec::push` and then returned `Ok(())`
  unconditionally, so a repetition parse collecting one element more than the slice can hold
  unwound the parser instead of returning `Err(item)` and reaching the `FullContainer` path the
  `Container` trait exposes a refusal channel for. Nothing unusual was needed to reach it: safe
  public API, an ordinary element parser, and an element count the *input* chooses. Every other
  fixed-capacity adapter — `Option`, `ArrayDeque`, `tinyvec::ArrayVec`, both `heapless`
  containers — already refused through `Err`, so the behaviour also depended on which backend a
  grammar happened to name. The adapter now tests the bound itself and hands the item back
  unchanged; `SliceVec` still cannot grow, and the refusal is `FullContainer` naming the slice's
  real capacity, because capacity exhaustion is exactly what that diagnostic is for and a second
  refusal kind would contradict the contract below.

- **`Container<T>` states the two obligations the repetition drivers actually rest on, and the
  drivers stopped resting on the four they never stated** (#258). `push_element` built
  `FullContainer`'s count out of `container.len() + 1`. `len()` is caller-implemented, so that
  number was invented by the container and then believed — believed to be unchanged by a refused
  push, to have moved by exactly one per accepted push, and never to exceed `max_capacity()`. No
  documentation said any of it, and `len() + 1` on a `len()` of `usize::MAX` overflows.

  The drivers already had the number: `nums`, their own count of elements *parsed*, so the four
  assumptions are simply gone. `first`, `last` and `len` are no longer read by the repetition
  machinery at all. The remaining arithmetic cannot overflow for the reason the counter itself
  cannot: `nums` is incremented once per parsed element by the same function.

  **`FullContainer` therefore states a refusal rather than an exceedance, and its rendered text
  changed.** The old sentence — *"found {nums} elements, which exceeds the maximum capacity of
  {limit}"* — related a count of *this construct's* parsed elements to the destination's *total*
  capacity, which is a claim about how full the destination already was. Only `container.len()`
  ever supplied that, and a payload the drivers compute for themselves cannot support it: an
  `Option` handed to `collect_with` already holding a value is a conforming destination, refuses
  the construct's first parsed element, and rendered *"found 1 elements, which exceeds the
  maximum capacity of 1"*. `nums()` is now documented as **which element of the construct was
  refused**, `capacity()` as the destination's total bound, the two are explicitly not
  comparable, and the text reads:

  ```text
  element {nums} of this construct was refused by a destination that holds at most {limit}
  ```

  Both numbers keep the values they had on this branch, so a consumer reading `nums()` and
  `capacity()` sees no change; a consumer that renders, matches or asserts on the text does. The
  alternative — an occupancy contract that would let the arithmetic claim stand — was rejected:
  it re-acquires the caller-implemented dependency this entry removes, and adds obligations
  (a starting occupancy, that a refused push does not change it, that it never passes
  `max_capacity`) that nothing can check.

  The suppression of later refusals is likewise no longer an inference. It used to be justified
  by *"a container that refuses one push refuses every later one"* — a law the trait never
  imposed and a downstream implementation was free to break. It is now a diagnostic policy, one
  report per construct, describing the refusal that was actually witnessed and predicting
  nothing about the next push.

  What is left is stated on the two methods that mean it, generically and enumerating nothing:
  `Container::push` refuses only when the container cannot hold the item, and
  `Container::max_capacity` is the bound it refuses at. Those two are what give a refusal its only possible reading; the rest was
  removable and was removed rather than written down, because an obligation nobody can check is
  a cost with no keeper.

- **The destination's capacity report reaches the emitter at the refusal, so a fail-fast parse
  stops there** (#277). `FullContainer` is emitted from `push_element`'s refusal arm, the moment
  the destination says no. Under `Fatal` — documented to stop at the first error — a container
  that refuses element 2 of a construct now ends the parse at element 2.

  **What #277 originally asked for is the opposite, and it cannot be had.** The eight drivers
  detect a violated maximum at three different moments — mid-loop in `repeated` and
  `repeated_while`, from an end callback in the four delimited forms, from the end-state pass in
  the four separated ones — so an element that both exceeds `at_most` and fills the destination
  produces `[TooMany, FullContainer]` under two builders and `[FullContainer, TooMany]` under
  the other six. Withholding the capacity report until each driver's end-state pass makes that
  order uniform. It also moves *when the emitter is consulted*, and in a collection driver the
  emitter is not a log — it is what decides whether the parse continues. Withheld, the report
  cost three things:

  - `Fatal` no longer stopped at the refusal. It parsed the rest of the construct first — nine
    element attempts over `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8` into a capacity-1 destination, against two.
  - Any later `Err` exit — a lexer error, an element failure, a delimiter, a recovery stop —
    propagated past the withheld report and **discarded a diagnostic that had been witnessed**.
    Over `1 2 oops` the parse's error was the element-3 failure, and the refusal at element 2
    was never told.
  - A refusal stopped being constant work. It is an O(1) decision made at element 2; withheld,
    delivering it took O(n) over trailing input the caller does not choose — 4099 element
    attempts against 4096 trailing elements, a 1366x amplification.

  **The two emitter classes want opposite things and the trait cannot tell them apart.** A
  rejecting emitter needs the call at the refusal; a recovering one would prefer it after the
  count bounds. `Emitter` exposes no classification, and could not usefully expose one: the
  class is a property of the **call and its argument**, not of the emitter — an error-budget
  emitter recovers until its budget runs out. The only signal is the `Result` the call returns,
  and reading it means having made the call. So the rule is applied in the direction that fails
  safe: emitting at the refusal costs a recovering emitter one diagnostic's position in one
  history, and withholding it costs a rejecting emitter its documented contract, a witnessed
  diagnostic, and a bound on its work.

  **What a recovering emitter sees instead.** The order is chronological, and it differs by
  driver in the one history where both diagnostics fire: `[TooMany, FullContainer]` under
  `repeated` and `repeated_while`, whose mid-loop maximum hook runs before the push, and
  `[FullContainer, TooMany]` under the other six, whose maximum is detected after the loop.
  `end_state_parity`'s case H asserts each driver's own order rather than one shared vector, and
  `capacity_report_timing.rs` holds the three properties above. `CAPACITY_REPORT_CENSUS` pins
  the emission to the region between `push_element`'s definition and the `*nums += 1` that ends
  its refusal arm, so a call relocated to any exit fails it.

  What `push_element` already forbade is unchanged: a container that ran out of room still
  cannot disturb the count bounds' *arithmetic*, because `nums` counts the elements the driver
  parsed and never the elements the container stored.

- **An owning `Collect` no longer carries a failed attempt's elements into the next one** (#256).
  The container was transferred out of the parser with `parse(..).map(|_| mem::take(..))`, which
  runs on the success arm only. An attempt that accepted elements and then failed left them in
  the parser object, so reusing that parser appended to the residue and could return values the
  caller never fed it — `at_most(1)` over `1 2 3` failed, then returned `[1, 3]` where the second
  invocation had parsed only `3`. A long-lived parser reused across inputs mixed them, and
  repeated failures grew the buffer for its lifetime.

  The storage now moves out of `self` **before** the attempt, into attempt-local storage, through
  one shared helper the twenty-eight owning transfer sites (plain, `*_while`, separated,
  delimited, and every spanned form) all route through. Success hands back the attempt's own
  storage; `Err` drops it; a **panic** drops it by ordinary unwinding, so a host that catches one
  can reuse the parser — which taking the container on both arms afterwards cannot express. A
  `collect_with` seed is the first attempt's storage and shares its fate: a failed attempt drops
  the seed rather than leaving it, plus whatever was collected on top of it, as the next
  attempt's starting point. Borrowed `Collect<_, &mut Container, _>` is a different contract —
  the caller owns and observes that container — and is unchanged.

- **`std` without `alloc` no longer fails to compile the `tinyvec` adapters.** The `std` feature
  listed `tinyvec_1?/default`, and **tinyvec's `default` is empty**, so that entry enabled nothing
  at all while reading like every other line around it. `TinyVec` exists only under tinyvec's
  `alloc`, and the three `TinyVec` impls — `Container`, `SeparatorHandler`, `DelimiterHandler` —
  are gated on `any(std, alloc)`. So `--no-default-features --features std,tinyvec_1` type-checked
  those bodies against a tinyvec that has no `TinyVec` and failed with `E0432`. `--all-features`
  was the only build that ever compiled them, which is why nothing caught it until
  `ci/feature_cfg_coverage.py` gained a `std,logos,combinators,tinyvec_1` leg, whose first run
  reported it.

  `std` now names `tinyvec_1?/alloc` — the identical entry the `alloc` feature already carries, so
  the manifest states what the `cfg` states: either capability needs one thing from tinyvec, that
  `TinyVec` exist. Narrowing the `cfg` to `alloc` compiles just as well and was rejected, because
  it drops the impls from every `std` build, which is a behaviour change wearing a build fix's
  clothes. Nothing else moved. tinyvec's own `std` is deliberately *not* enabled — it adds
  `io::Write for TinyVec<[u8; N]>`, `Error for TryFromSliceError` and its own `no_std` opt-out,
  none of which tokora names — and `--features tinyvec_1` alone still compiles the `ArrayVec` and
  `SliceVec` adapters without a heap. Every other `/default` entry in the `std` list was checked
  against its own crate's `default` at the version `Cargo.lock` resolves; tinyvec's was the only
  empty one.

- **Two quadratic scans in the lossless CST sink, one of them in release builds** (#250, #253).
  Both were `Theta(n^2)` in the size of an ordinary parse, neither needed malformed input,
  backtracking or the raw surface, and neither was visible to any output-tree test — the first
  wrote nothing at all and the second recomputed a value it already agreed with.

  **`Sink::wrap_hole` walked the whole retro-wrap undo journal on every recovery hole** (#250),
  bumping two indices per entry. Both branch conditions are unreachable, and the loop's own comment
  said so — which is exactly why deleting it needed a proof rather than a quotation, since a wrong
  proof here does not cost time, it silently renames journal indices. The proof is now written at
  the site and stands on two facts about the code rather than on today's producers: `cst_start_at`
  is the only producer and its `validate_mark` in-bounds check makes `index < at_len - 1`
  structurally, so every live entry has a `StartAt` standing at `at_len - 1`; and the backward scan
  that computes the splice point `at` breaks on anything that is not a `Token` or a `Diag`, so
  every index at or above `at` is one of those two and a `StartAt` is neither. Hence
  `at_len <= at` and `index < at`, for every entry, in every reachable state — recovery inside a
  Pratt fold, a partial session, a rewound checkpoint. Measured before the fix at exactly `J x H`
  journal visits with `J` retro-wraps and `H` holes (4.00x per doubling, both profiles); the same
  shape at `J = H = 4096` is **8.8x faster in release** and **10.9x in debug**, and both curves are
  now linear. What replaces the loop is a `debug_assert` on the **newest** entry only — `O(1)`, not
  the `O(J)` an `iter().all()` would cost — which decides the whole journal because `at_len` is
  strictly increasing, and that ordering is itself now pinned by a `debug_assert` at the push.

  **`Sink::cst_finish` recomputed the open-node depth from the event suffix on every close**
  (#253), inside its global-underflow `debug_assert!`. The recount is anchored at the newest
  emitter checkpoint or released floor, and the CST channel mints neither: the blessed `node()`
  bracket takes no emitter checkpoint, so a predictive grammar of flat sibling nodes rescanned the
  whole accumulated prefix once per node — `3n(n - 1)/2 + 2n` event visits, measured exactly, both
  at the sink and end to end through `cst::parse_lossless` (4.00x per doubling). Release builds
  compiled the assert out, so this was a debug, test, tooling and fuzzing cost, including the
  default `cargo test` profile — and the fix had to add nothing to release. Depth is now a
  maintained scalar rather than a recount, restored at a truncating rewind from the frozen depth
  the target row already carried (or `0` at the origin), and left alone by every rewind that
  truncates nothing. 16 384 flat siblings went from **2.09 s to 0.58 ms in debug**, curve `3.94x`
  to `1.99x`; release is unchanged in behaviour and now pays `O(1)` at `Emitter::checkpoint` too,
  which used to carry the same recount in every build.

  The module's standing claim that depth is *"derived, never cached — a cached counter would need
  its own restore rule"* is retired with the recount: the restore rule turned out to be three lines
  the rewind contract had already forced into existence. What keeps the scalar exact is arity, not
  discipline — **one** helper appends to the event log and charges the event's own `depth_delta`,
  the one non-append mutation charges its two halves at its own site, and `DEPTH_CENSUS` fails the
  build if a second `events.push` or `events.insert` appears. The equivalence to a full recount is
  pinned across nesting, retro-wraps, demotes, hole wraps, raw injection, released floors and all
  four rewind arms. The global-underflow check stays a `debug_assert` even though it is now free:
  release refuses the same misuse typed through both finish doors, and a typed refusal a host can
  catch is a stronger wall for a library than a panic.

  No public API moved. The released-floor memo shrank from a whole mark-stack row to its mark,
  because the depth half stopped having a reader.

- **The other two quadratic scans in the same sink — the ones the census for #250/#253 found and
  did not fix** (#305, #306). Both are in `cst/sink.rs`, both were measured before the repair and
  after it, and they are unrelated to each other: different mechanisms, different profiles,
  different structures.

  **`Sink::wrap_hole` rescanned the whole accumulated diagnostic run on every recovery hole whose
  span matched no buffered token** (#305) — **`Theta(H^2)` in every profile, release included**.
  The backward scan steps over `Event::Diag` unconditionally, which is what lets a hole wrap
  tokens that already carry diagnostics; when the hole matches no token the wrap appends **no**
  structural event, so nothing stops the next scan, and `emit_skipped_region` forwards its own
  report and lengthens the run by one. Measured at exactly `H(H - 1)/2` event visits — 2 096 128
  / 8 386 560 / 33 550 336 / 134 209 536 / 536 854 528 at `H` = 2048/4096/8192/16384/32768, with
  release wall times of 3.58 / 13.56 / 55.25 / 220.62 / 882.29 ms (3.79x, 4.07x, 3.99x, 4.00x per
  doubling). The ordinary case was never affected: a hole that *does* wrap tokens appends a
  `StartNode`/`FinishNode` pair, and those break the next hole's scan.

  **No in-crate producer can reach it, and a consumer can.** `InputRef::sync_balanced` is this
  crate's only emitter of skipped regions, and three independent properties of it each rule the
  shape out — its `skipped` count is incremented only from the one per-token decision site, which
  a crossed lexer error never reaches; every counted token was settled through `commit_token` and
  therefore has a `Token` event; and its emitter checkpoint is taken before the scan, so the wrap's
  floor sits below the first of them. Any one of the three makes `skipped > 0` imply a wrappable
  token. `ParseState::emit_skipped_region` — reachable from `InputRef` and `EmitterView` — takes a
  **caller-chosen** span, and a span matching no buffered token produces exactly the shape.

  The repair is **E6, `Sink::diag_tail`**: the index at which the buffer's pure-`Diag` tail begins,
  so the scan enters there instead of at the length. It changes no wrap and no tree — the skipped
  iterations are exactly the ones the `Diag` arm would have `continue`d over, and the first index
  the scan does examine is a non-`Diag` by the cell's own invariant, so an empty wrap now breaks on
  its first iteration and every scan's run is disjoint from every other's. The alternative shape —
  making the empty wrap leave a structural stopper — was priced and rejected: an empty `error_kind`
  node would change the tree a consumer sees and contradict the documented "token-less holes
  produce no node", and an opaque marker event would instead *narrow* a later, wider wrap at a
  boundary with no semantic meaning. Rewind is where a watermark of this kind usually breaks, and
  this one has no rule of its own to get wrong: it copies #253's, off a new frozen field on the
  same mark-stack row. After the repair the same curves are **1 visit per hole** and 0.030 / 0.053
  / 0.097 / 0.191 / 0.285 ms — linear, and **3096x** faster at `H = 32768`.

  **`Sink::cst_demote`'s debug wall recounted the event suffix on every demote, success included**
  (#306) — `Theta(d x len)`, debug and test builds only, measured at exactly `d(d - 1)` visits:
  65 280 / 261 632 / 1 047 552 / 4 192 256 at nesting depth 256/512/1024/2048, 4.00x per doubling,
  and **0** in release, where the scan is compiled out. Through the blessed `node()` bracket the
  suffix is exactly that bracket's own body and `d` is capped by
  `RecursionLimiter::PARSE_DEFAULT_DEPTH` — **32** in both profiles now, not the 1024 the issue was
  filed against — so the blessed-door exposure is a bounded constant on failing brackets; the raw
  `CstEmitter` surface is not bounded by the limiter at all, and that is what the measurement above
  drives.

  **#253's maintained depth cannot serve this scan, and neither can an early exit.** The scan wants
  the *running minimum* of the suffix, and a scalar total is blind to a dip that recovers:
  `Start(A) … Finish(A) … Start(C)` ends where it began with the marked node closed anyway. Nor can
  the walk stop short — every delta is in `{-1, 0, +1}`, so from any position both a later dip and
  no later dip stay reachable with the events that remain, travelling in either direction. What the
  total *does* decide in `O(1)` is only the sub-case where the endpoint itself is low, which is not
  the residue; taking it would have weakened the wall rather than accelerated it.

  So the repair is a structure — **E7/E8, `Sink::opens` / `Sink::open_top`**: the ordinary
  bracket-matching stack, laid out as an append-only vector of parent links so that its contents
  are a function of the event prefix and its head is one restorable scalar. An entry leaves the
  chain exactly when the depth first returns to one below its own start, so *on the chain* and
  *no dip above* are the same predicate, and the wall's verdict is unchanged on every input — the
  interleaved-closings strictness choice on the raw surface included. The old walk still runs, on
  the failing path only, because the dipping event is still the diagnosis. **Release pays nothing**:
  the chain, its row field and the check are all behind `debug_assertions`, and release's wall
  remains the typed refusal both finish doors already raise. 2048 nested failing brackets went from
  **4 192 256 event-suffix visits to 0**, and the wall from 19.77 ms to 0.139 ms in the dev profile (re-measured end to end on the
  committed `#[ignore]`d harness, which reproduces the pre-repair base at 17.34 ms: **17.34 ms
  → 0.10 ms**, best of five).

  **The membership query is `O(log depth)`, not `O(1)`, and the first cut of this repair was
  `O(depth)` — which was not enough.** Following `parent` a link at a time is bounded through the
  blessed `node()` combinator, where `RecursionLimiter` caps the nesting; the **raw `CstEmitter`
  surface is not bounded by that limiter at all**, and #306 named that surface as a requirement.
  Open `n` same-kind nodes, then for `k = 0 … n − 2` demote the `k`-th and open a fresh one, then
  close `n` times: every mark is distinct and live so every query succeeds, the failing path's
  suffix scan never runs, the chain never gets shorter, and the `k`-th walk passes `n − k` links.
  `Θ(n²)` — #306's own shape, surviving its own repair on the surface it was filed about. The
  measured shape hid it, because closing innermost-first means every query hits the chain's own
  head and reads exactly one entry: `O(1)` for a reason that has nothing to do with the structure.

  Each entry therefore also carries its depth and a **skip link** laid down by Myers' skew-binary
  rule — hops of 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, … — and the query *descends* the chain instead of walking
  it, taking a skip whenever its landing point is still at or above the queried index. Worst-case
  entry reads for a single query are `4·log₂(n) − 4` (12 / 28 / 44 / 52 at depth 16 / 256 / 4096 /
  16384), and the adversarial run above went from `n(n+1)/2 − 1` reads to `O(n log n)`: 32 895 /
  131 327 / 524 799 / 2 098 175 became 4 885 / 11 287 / 25 625 / 57 371 at `n` = 256/512/1024/2048
  — 4.00x per doubling down to 2.3x, and 36.6x fewer reads at `n = 2048`. The shape that hid it is
  unaffected: 2048 innermost-first demotes still read exactly one entry each.

  **The ladder needs no restore rule of its own**, which is why it could be added without
  reopening the rewind argument. Every field of an entry is written once at the push and never
  revisited, and a skip link is always a *proper ancestor* on its own entry's chain, so the slots
  a search can reach from a restored head are a subset of the parent chain — all below the mark,
  all kept by the existing pop loop. The `O(1)` alternative, a depth-indexed spine, was rejected
  for exactly the property the ladder has: later opens overwrite a spine's slots, so a truncating
  rewind would have to rebuild it in `O(depth)`, moving the cost off the query and onto every
  rewind. Growth is the log's and needs no ceiling of its own: one entry per depth-increasing
  event still in `events`, dying with it, so `opens.len() ≤ events.len()` at every moment.

  A closed node's chain slot is deliberately **never** reclaimed, and that is the one place this
  could have gone wrong quietly: reusing it would hold the vector at the live depth for a
  well-nested document and leave a checkpoint's frozen head naming an unrelated node after a
  truncate-and-reopen rewind. Both that shape and a wrap reaching under a diagnostic run are cells,
  and both were confirmed to fail against a planted defect before being trusted. The equivalence
  the wall now rests on is not prose: `depth_matches_oracle` compares the maintained chain against
  a from-scratch replay, and the skip-link search against the `parent` walk it replaced at every
  event index, at every site that already walked every path writing #253's depth. The `Θ(n²)`
  shape above is a committed work-counter test that counts both sides of the same query at the
  same states, so the walk's quadratic is the plant that keeps the ladder's bound from passing
  vacuously; the two wall-clock figures quoted here have committed `#[ignore]`d harnesses.

  No public API moved. `Event`, `EventMark` and every emitter signature are untouched; a debug
  build's chain entry grows by 8 bytes, and a release build's `Sink` gains one `u64` on the struct
  and one on each mark-stack row and pays nothing else — every line of the chain, the ladder and
  the query is behind `debug_assertions`.

- **`Limiter`'s combined update-and-check methods reported `Ok(())` over a recursion depth that
  was already past its maximum** (#265). `Tracker::check` promises to report whether *any*
  configured limit is exceeded, and the trait's combined methods were documented and defaulted as
  "update, then run that check". `Limiter` overrode two of them and ended each with
  `<Self as TokenTracker>::check`, so `increase_token_and_check` and
  `increase_token_and_decrease_recursion_and_check` answered `Ok(())` for as long as the token
  count held — the decrementing form included, whose entire job is to report what is left over
  after the decrement. When both limits were exceeded the same two returned the *token* error
  while `Limiter::check` returned the recursion one, so the combined form and the full check
  disagreed about which limit tripped. Reproduced with a token maximum of `usize::MAX` and a
  recursion maximum of `1`: `Ok(())` at depth 2, directly and through a `Limiter` installed as
  `logos` extras, which forwarded the narrowing faithfully.

  Nothing in tokora called these — `ParserContext` and the input layer hold a `RecursionLimiter`
  directly — so no in-tree grammar's ceiling was evadable through them, and the recursion budget
  the parser enforces was never affected. The exposure was a downstream parser using the
  advertised one-call operations as its limit check.

  **The repair is that the composition is no longer a customization point.** Deleting the two
  overrides would have fixed the two call sites; the methods moved to a blanket-implemented
  `TrackerExt` / `RecursionTrackerExt` instead (see **Changed (breaking)**), so coherence refuses
  any impl that could narrow one again — `Limiter`'s, the two `logos` forwarders' (which
  hand-wrote the same five delegations and are now gone), and any downstream tracker's. The
  mistake was easy for a structural reason: `Limiter` implements `RecursionTracker`, `TokenTracker`
  and `Tracker`, so inside `impl Tracker for Limiter` a bare `self.check()` is ambiguous across
  three candidates and a body there *must* name one. There is now no such body to write.
  `tests/ui/tracker_combined_check_cannot_be_narrowed.rs` holds the wall, because a narrowed check
  has no runtime shadow — it is indistinguishable from a tracker that was within its limits.

  Also corrected: `increase_both`'s doc claimed it checked limits (it does not) and
  `increase_both_and_check`'s claimed it decreased recursion (it increases both).
- **An element refused by both its count maximum and its destination reports the maximum first, in
  every repetition driver** (#277). `at_most(1)` over a capacity-one container and two parsed
  elements recorded `[TooMany, FullContainer]` under `repeated`/`repeated_while` and
  `[FullContainer, TooMany]` under the other six builders — and under `Fatal`, which stops at the
  first diagnostic, the **public parse error changed from `TooMany` to `FullContainer` because the
  caller picked another builder**. `tests/end_state_parity.rs` states the contrary invariant in one
  line: the same logical history must produce the same diagnostic vector no matter which builder
  the user picked.

  **The order was not a free choice between two symmetric candidates.** Three readings pick the
  same one. *Chronologically*, "this element exceeds the maximum" is settled by the driver's own
  parsed-element count the moment the element parses, while "the destination refused it" cannot be
  settled until the driver offers it — strictly later; no history has one element's refusal
  preceding its own count verdict, so the divergence was a placement accident. *By dependency*, the
  maximum is decidable without asking anyone, while the refusal is a caller-implemented
  `Container`'s answer, and the accounting already treats that container as untrusted input rather
  than a participant. And *by which fact the parse turns on*: a same-element collision can only
  happen at element `max + 1`, and only if elements `1..=max` were accepted (a destination that
  refused earlier already spent the construct's one capacity report on that earlier element), so
  the destination is provably large enough for every element the grammar allows — **enlarging it
  never clears the parse, while trimming the input to `max` elements clears both**. The maximum is
  the root; the refusal is a consequence of parsing an element the grammar had already rejected.

  **The repair is one admission, not eight agreements.** `parser::many::push_element` becomes
  `admit_element`: it takes the collection's cardinality handler, runs that handler's element hook,
  and *then* offers the element to the destination. All twelve element-admission sites across the
  eight drivers go through it, so the order is two consecutive lines in one function rather than a
  convention twelve loop bodies each have to keep. That shape is the point — #259 will rewrite this
  subtree into shared engines, and an ordering held by convention is one a rewrite inherits by
  luck. `ELEMENT_ADMISSION_CENSUS` pins it structurally: no driver spells `container.push` or the
  element hook itself, the admissions are counted per driver, and inside the chokepoint the hook is
  proven to precede the push. `tests/repetition_diagnostic_order.rs` proves it at runtime over a
  declared table — all eight builder families crossed with `at_most` and `bounded`, and all nine
  separator policies including the four nested ones — asserting the `Verbose` vector and the
  `Fatal` result once over the list rather than once per row. Twenty-one of its twenty-five
  collision rows were red before this change.

  **The maximum stops being an end-of-construct fact.** `Maximum::check` and
  `With<Minimum, Maximum>::check` no longer emit, and neither do the four delimited-repeated
  `on_stop` closures; `emit_too_many` now has exactly two call sites in the crate, both element
  hooks, and the six sources that lost theirs are still scanned so one cannot come back. Four
  consequences reach consumers of the six affected builders, all of them the fail-fast properties
  the capacity report already had:

  - a rejecting emitter now stops **at the element that broke the limit** rather than after the
    whole construct, so `at_most(1)` over a thousand elements no longer parses all thousand first,
    and a failed attempt leaves the input inside its construct rather than past it;
  - a later `Err` exit — a lexer error, a delimiter miss, an element failure — no longer propagates
    over a `TooMany` that was already witnessed and discards it;
  - the `TooMany` span now ends at the offending element instead of at the end of the construct
    (the payload, `limit + 1`, is unchanged, and was already uniform);
  - where both fire, `TooMany` now precedes a trailing-separator diagnostic and a `TooFew`, which
    is what the two plain builders already did.

  Cross-element order is untouched: a destination that fills at element 3 while the maximum is
  first exceeded at element 5 still records `[FullContainer, TooMany]`, under every driver, because
  those are two elements and the refusal really did happen first. That control history runs beside
  the collision rows, and it is what separates fixing the collision from flipping the order
  globally.

- **`#![recursion_limit = "256"]` in `tokora/src/lib.rs`, and two new CI jobs so a publish-time
  failure surfaces at merge time instead.** `cargo +nightly package -p tokora` failed at "failed
  to verify package tarball": `hybrid_arraydeque::generic_array::IsWithinUsizeBound` proves a
  typenum integer fits `usize` through a type-level `Shl` chain whose depth tracks the 64-bit
  word width rather than the deque's own capacity, and against typenum < 1.20.1 that chain
  overflows the default 128-frame limit while checking the blanket `impl Default for Parser<(),
  L, O, FatalContext<'inp, L, E, Lang>>`. `#![deny(warnings)]` turns the new
  `recursion_depth_exceeding_limit` lint (rust-lang/rust#159228) — future-incompat, and it becomes
  a hard error — into exactly that build failure, so shielding a downstream build with
  `--cap-lints allow` would not have survived the lint's graduation. Bisected floor against the
  pre-fix pair is 137; the crate now carries 256.

  **Neither this crate nor its dependency pins the fix, so a fresh `cargo publish` succeeding
  today is not proof the class is closed.** `generic-arraydeque` requires only
  `generic-array = "1"`, and `generic-array` itself required just `typenum ^1.19` before its own
  1.4.3 raised that to `^1.20.1` — so today's freshest resolution sails past this defect by
  picking the newest pair, while a downstream consumer's own lockfile, or any resolution that
  lands on `generic-array` < 1.4.3, can still reach the overflow. Reproduced directly by pinning
  back to generic-array 1.4.2 and typenum 1.19.0, which hits the identical diagnostic.

  **No CI job ran either shape of the failing command.** Every check, test and clippy line in
  `ci.yml` type-checks `tokora` as a workspace member; `cargo package`'s isolated, re-resolved
  verify build is a different one, and nothing ran it. Nor did the by-hand set's own
  `cargo +nightly check -p tokora --all-targets --all-features` line, which was never mirrored
  into CI. `package (publish verification)` — `cargo +stable package -p tokora`, merge-blocking
  — and `nightly check (advisory)` — the bare check, then that by-hand line, both
  `continue-on-error: true` like `semver-checks` — close both gaps.


### Source-breaking additions that can change behaviour with *no diagnostic at the call site*

**`Status` is a new public name in `tokora::types`** (#320). A consumer with
`use tokora::types::*;` and a `Status` of their own gets `error[E0659]` at the name, resolved by an
explicit import or an `as` alias. `RecoveryState` and `FromComponents` are **not** in that
namespace — they live in `tokora::types::recovery` and must be named, because a trait behind a
glob is picked silently where a type is not.

*Three earlier drafts of this release listed more names here, and all are withdrawn.* The third
listed `with_status` as a new inherent associated function that could not be displaced silently,
because its `Status` parameter is a type no pre-upgrade code can produce. That is true only of
expressions whose type comes from the expression; an `unsafe { zeroed() }` takes its type from the
**parameter**, compiles on both revisions, and moves dispatch. There is no inherent `with_status`
any more — see `FromComponents` under **Added**.* The first
listed `is_valid`, `is_error` and `is_missing` as new inherent methods on `Keyword` and the
seventeen `Lit*` types, offering UFCS as the fix; they are on `RecoveryState` and were never
shipped inherent. The second listed `status` beside `with_status` on the argument that a new
return type makes a clash loud; that argument is false, since `literal.status().is_valid()`
typechecks whichever `status` wins, and there is now no inherent `status` at all. **A note in this
section is the right home for a name that fails loudly and the wrong one for a name that rebinds
in silence** — and the test for which is whether the whole call chain still typechecks with a
different meaning, not whether the signature differs.

**`InputRef::trip_snapshot` and `InputRef::tripped_during_attempt` are new inherent methods on a
type that already shipped.** An inherent item wins the pick over an extension trait's, so a
consumer who wrote either name on `InputRef` runs their item on the base and tokora's here.

**The form is a decision, not an accident.** `InputRef` carries its whole surface as inherent
methods; an opt-in trait for these two alone would be the only accessor in the crate reachable
only after an import, and the witness has to be readable inside a generic production that imports
nothing. The cost of that choice is this section.

**You are exposed if you wrote a `trip_snapshot` or `tripped_during_attempt` method of your own on
[`InputRef`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/struct.InputRef.html).** The paired shape is the
one to look for, because it can compile on **both** revisions and switch both calls silently:

```rust,ignore
let baseline = inp.trip_snapshot();
inp.tripped_during_attempt(baseline)
```

The argument type is inferred, so nothing at the call site names which item won. **The fix is
UFCS**, which pins the item on either revision:

```rust,ignore
let baseline = MyExt::trip_snapshot(inp);
MyExt::tripped_during_attempt(inp, baseline)
```

`ci/name_collision/` scores the four generated rows `ok*` — justified in `no_collision.txt` — and
that classification is deliberately narrow. The `inherent_method` template's consumer takes
`&mut self` while both tokora items take `&self`, so the consumer's item is found one autoref step
earlier and wins on both sides: the probe is vacuous for these names and says so. **It is not
evidence that the names cannot be stolen.** A consumer whose extension item takes `&self` competes
at the same step tokora's does, and the harness cannot generate that consumer. This paragraph is
the coverage for that case, which is why it is here rather than in the probe's baseline.

`input::ResourceTripBaseline` is a new glob-reachable name in `tokora::input`; the probe scores it
`glob-err`, the disclosed outcome — a `use tokora::input::*` alongside another glob exporting the
same name is rejected by the compiler rather than silently resolved.

**`InputRef::at_scanner_stop` is a third new inherent method on the same type**, and every word
above transfers: it is `pub fn at_scanner_stop(&self) -> bool`, so a consumer who wrote that name
on `InputRef` as an extension item runs their item on the base and tokora's here. It takes **no
argument**, so unlike the pair above there is no inferred type to make the switch invisible — but
`bool` is the sort of return an extension would also have, so a call in a boolean position can
still compile on both revisions. **The fix is the same UFCS**: `MyExt::at_scanner_stop(inp)`.
`ci/name_collision/` scores its two rows `ok*` for the same narrow reason as the four above (the
template's consumer takes `&mut self`; tokora's item takes `&self`), which is why this paragraph
exists rather than the probe's baseline standing in for it.

**`InputRef::scanner_trip_snapshot` and `InputRef::scanner_stopped_during_attempt` are the fourth
and fifth**, and they are the scanner twins of the descent pair above, so every word of that
paragraph transfers verbatim — including the part that matters. The paired call passes the baseline
through inference (`let scan = inp.scanner_trip_snapshot(); … inp.scanner_stopped_during_attempt(scan)`),
so a consumer whose extension items take `&self` keeps compiling on both revisions with the
resolution silently switched. **The fix is the same UFCS**: `MyExt::scanner_trip_snapshot(inp)` and
`MyExt::scanner_stopped_during_attempt(inp, scan)`. `input::ScannerTripBaseline` is a new
glob-reachable name in `tokora::input` on the same terms as `input::ResourceTripBaseline` above.

**`InputRef::scanner_attempt` and `InputRef::scanner_outcome` are the sixth and seventh**, on the
same terms again: both are `&self`, the paired call passes the capture through inference, and the
UFCS spellings are `MyExt::scanner_attempt(inp)` and `MyExt::scanner_outcome(inp, &att)`.
`input::ScannerAttempt` and `input::ScannerOutcome` are new glob-reachable names in `tokora::input`.
`ScannerOutcome` is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so a downstream `match` must carry a wildcard arm and a
later arm cannot break it.

**`InputRef::judge_scanner` is the eighth**, on the same terms — `&mut self` this time, so it
competes at the *same* first step the `inherent_method` template's consumer does; its two rows score
`loud` rather than `ok*`, which is the counter-control the paragraphs above describe and not an
exception to them. The UFCS spelling is `MyExt::judge_scanner(inp, f)`.

#247 removes `Errors`' `DerefMut` and replaces the three legitimate uses it served with inherent
methods. `Errors` has shipped since 0.7.3 **with no inherent item of its own**, so a consumer who
wanted `pop`, `clear` or `iter_mut` in a shape the deref did not give them wrote an extension
trait — and that helper now competes with a tokora method of the same name on the same receiver.
An inherent item wins the pick.

**You are exposed if you wrote a `pop`, `clear` or `iter_mut` method of your own on
[`Errors`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/error/struct.Errors.html).** Reproduced two-sided
by `ci/name_collision/`, base `40694dc` against this branch, on rustc 1.99.0-nightly:

```text
loud    clear/used          base=witness=1  head=no-compile
SILENT  clear/discarded     base=witness=1  head=witness=0
loud    iter_mut/used       base=witness=1  head=no-compile
SILENT  iter_mut/discarded  base=witness=1  head=witness=0
loud    pop/used            base=witness=1  head=no-compile
SILENT  pop/discarded       base=witness=1  head=witness=0
```

On the three discarded rows both sides compile, **neither emits any diagnostic**, and the two run
different programs: yours before, tokora's after. Every `used` row is `loud` on the same probe
(`E0308` against the consumer's `-> u8`), so a **discarded return** is the whole of the
difference. The discriminator is the lint rather than a `#[must_use]` attribute, measured per
name: `clear` returns `()`; `pop` returns an `Option`, which is not `#[must_use]` as a type; and
`iter_mut` returns the container's own `IterMut`, which the lint did not fire on either — the row
a rule of thumb would have called `warned`, and the reason the set is measured rather than
reasoned about. **The remedy is UFCS**: `MyTrait::pop(&mut errors)` pins your method by name and
is immune to this.

The deref does not enter it, which is worth saying because the base side still had one: a deref
step is walked only after every pick on `Errors` itself has failed, and the consumer's item is
found at the `&mut Errors` pick. The before-state is the consumer's item on both readings.

`ErrorContainer`'s two new names are **not** in this section, and for two different reasons.
`clear` is a `&mut self` trait method, so it sits at a strictly later pick than either consumer
shape the harness can generate, the three rows agree on both sides, and they are justified by name
in `no_collision.txt` rather than read as green — `Emitter::commit_lexer_error`'s analysis exactly.
`from_errors` declares no receiver, so a call to it walks no receiver chain at all: tokora's item
and a consumer's own extension item are both applicable at the one pick, and rustc refuses to
choose. Both rows are loud, by `E0034`:

```text
loud    from_errors/used        base=witness=1  head=no-compile
loud    from_errors/discarded   base=witness=1  head=no-compile
```

It is the trait's first receiver-less item since it shipped, which is why `gen_probe.py`'s
`ErrorContainer` record gains a `self_ty`. That field was absent on the reading that `new` and
`with_capacity` were the only receiver-less items and both pre-existing — true when written, and
the kind of statement a new constructor falsifies. A missing `self_ty` is FATAL rather than a
skipped row, so the harness would have said so.

Recorded in `ci/name_collision/disclosed.txt`, and on **this** branch: the probe's inventory is a
two-sided delta, so once this merges the names exist on both sides, the rows leave every future
plan, and the harness can never re-litigate them.

- **A lexer limit trip could be decided and then not recorded, if the consumer's error type had a
  destructor.** `latch_if_limit_tripped` — the crate's terminal predicate, and the sole route by
  which a lexer-side resource trip reaches `Input::scanner_trips` and the poison boundary — asked
  `if lexer.check().is_err()`. `Lexer::check` answers with `Token::Error`, which is bounded
  `Clone + Debug` and nothing more, so it may carry a `Drop`; and the scrutinee of an `if` is a
  temporary destroyed **at the end of the condition, before the branch body is entered**. So the
  order of events was: terminality decided, consumer destructor runs, and only then the two writes
  that record it. An unwind out of that destructor, caught inside an `attempt` by a host that then
  left without re-entering the scanner, saw both carriers clean — and `next` folds a terminal stop
  into `Ok(None)`, so the counter was the only evidence there was. Measured over `"ab cd ef gh"`
  with a tally tripping on the third item: `(2 items reported Ok, check() answered Err once, 0
  scanner trips, not poisoned)` — **a successful parse over truncated input**. The predicate now
  binds the answer (`if let Err(error) = …`), publishes both facts, and drops the error by name
  afterwards; the same cell reads `(2, 1, 1, poisoned)` at every error destructor in the round
  (`a_limit_trip_is_all_or_nothing_at_every_lexer_error_destructor`).

  This is the fourth window of one shape — *a consumer-controlled value created inside a condition
  or an intermediate expression, destroyed at the end of that expression, before the durable
  publication the decision implies* — and the three before it were all in this branch's own new
  code. The whole publication region has now been enumerated mechanically rather than by
  inspection: over the MIR of every body in the crate that performs one of the four durable writes,
  every `drop` terminator was classified by whether a durable write **post-dominates** it, which is
  exactly the property "the obligation is already incurred here". Twenty-three destruction sites
  across the five bodies; one was in the class, and it was this one. `TRIP_CENSUS` in
  `census_tests.rs` now derives the set of publishing methods from the source, so a new one cannot
  arrive without declaring the decision that obliges it.

- **The staged/publish split's "by construction" claim is now true by construction.** The
  `StagedTrip` carrier that makes the fallible clamp precede the infallible writes was a bare
  `enum` in `input_ref/mod.rs`, so its variants were nameable throughout `input_ref` and every
  descendant of it — which is precisely the set of modules that can also reach
  `publish_scanner_trip`. No forged caller existed, but `StagedTrip::Lower(b)` from a sibling
  module compiled, and it would have published a boundary that was never compared against the
  latch. The representation moved into a private child module (`input_ref/staged_trip.rs`) behind
  an opaque newtype with a private field: `StagedTrip::stage` is now the only expression in the
  language that produces one, and the forged spellings are `error[E0599]` and `error[E0603]`.

## 0.9.1 (2026-08-08)

### Added

- **`tokora::diagnostic` — the structured half of an error, as one dyn-safe contract.** A front
  end's lexical, syntactic and semantic errors come from three different places and, until now,
  had only `Display` in common: a consumer wanting `miette`, `ariadne`, `codespan-reporting`, an
  LSP `Diagnostic` or a protocol's own error object had to re-derive structure from a formatted
  sentence, or go without. The new module publishes that structure and nothing else — `Diagnose`,
  `DiagnoseExt`, `Code`, `Severity`, `Location`, `Label`, `PathSegment`, and the `Labels` /
  `PathSegments` iterator adapters.

  **It is not behind a feature, and does not want one.** It names no renderer, adds no
  dependency, and is `core::fmt` plus `SimpleSpan`, so it compiles under
  `--no-default-features` and for `thumbv6m-none-eabi` exactly as it does on a server. A gate
  would put a `cfg` on every consumer's re-export and buy back nothing that is not already
  free.

  **Reading a diagnostic allocates nothing, and that is measured rather than asserted.** Not
  because input-varying data is kept out of the structure — most of it is in there — but because
  every part of the structure has a representation that reaches no allocator: coordinates travel
  by value (`Location`'s span, `PathSegment::Index`, `Severity`), fixed text is `&'static str` (a
  `Code`, a `Label`'s phrase, a `help` line), and variable text is **borrowed** — a
  `PathSegment::Field`'s response key comes from the document, so it is a `&str` into a buffer the
  producer already holds, which is what `PathSegment`'s lifetime parameter is for and why it must
  not be flattened into the message. All three are `Copy`, so the whole structure reads through
  `&dyn Diagnose` without a move.
  `tests/diagnostic_contract.rs` reads the whole contract through `&dyn Diagnose` — code,
  severity, primary, primary label, every secondary label, every path segment, help, and both
  iterator adapters — and renders the message into a fixed stack buffer under a counting global
  allocator, for **0** allocation events. A discrimination check beside it shows the same
  counter reporting a real allocation, so the zero means "nothing allocated" rather than
  "nothing was looking"; both gates were watched going red against planted defects.

  **Why indexed accessors rather than iterators.** `fn labels(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item =
  Label>` and its GAT spelling both make the trait dyn-incompatible, and `&dyn Diagnose` is the
  whole point: a renderer holds three families in one collection, and boxing each one to get
  there would allocate for a value designed not to. A count plus an indexed accessor is dyn-safe
  and allocation-free, and that is the whole of what it buys: it gives a renderer structured,
  erasable, allocation-free access to an error, and **no length promise of any kind** — see the
  next entry. `DiagnoseExt` puts the iterators back on top and is blanket-implemented,
  `dyn Diagnose` included.

  **The adapters fail closed, and they carry `FusedIterator` but deliberately not
  `ExactSizeIterator`.** `Diagnose`'s count and its accessor are required to agree, but nothing in
  the type system makes them, and an impl that disagrees needs no `unsafe` and no panic — two
  methods answering different questions is enough, and `&self` plus a `Cell` is enough to make the
  answer move between calls. The marker traits on `Labels` and `PathSegments` are promises **the
  adapters** make, which a generic renderer relies on without ever seeing the `Diagnose` impl, so
  they have to hold regardless:

  - reaching an index the accessor answers `None` for **retires the cursor**, and every later call
    answers `None`. That makes `FusedIterator` true by construction rather than by trusting the
    implementor. Anything past the hole is dropped, which is the direction to fail in — a renderer
    showing too few labels is repairable, one walking a resumed iterator is not.
  - `ExactSizeIterator` is **not** implemented and must not be. Its contract is that the length is
    *exactly* known, and a length read through a trait object whose count may disagree with its
    accessor is not. Documenting it as conditional would be a footnote against a `std` marker
    nobody footnotes. `tests/ui/diagnose_adapters_are_not_exact_size.rs` is the rail: adding either
    impl back makes that case compile, which trybuild reports as a failure.
  - `Iterator::size_hint` answers `(0, Some(remaining))`. The **upper** half may be loose and this
    one is a genuine cap: the walk cannot run past the count it was sized from. The **lower** half
    may not — it is a claim that at least that many items will be produced, and retire-on-hole
    means the adapter can never raise it above zero, because the next index may be a hole. That is
    not free to get wrong: `Vec`'s `FromIterator` and `Extend` both reserve from the lower bound,
    so forwarding a declared count of a million behind one real label reserves for a million.
    Measured at `capacity = 1_000_000` on a 48-byte `Label`, from `collect` and from `extend`, on
    rustc 1.95.0, 1.97.1 and nightly — 48 MB of reservation reachable from any third-party
    `Diagnose` impl, which is the population this trait exists for.
  - **There is no pre-sizing route at all, and the module says why.** Indexed access was
    originally justified partly as a way to read the count and `Vec::with_capacity` from it. That
    benefit was asserted and never measured; the hazard opposite it was measured at 48 MB, and a
    reservation made before the walk starts is made before the fail-closed adapters can protect
    anything. Against that sits a handful of reallocations on a vector that in practice holds
    nought to five labels. So a declared count is not a capacity: not through
    `ExactSizeIterator`, not through `size_hint`, and not through a documented recipe either. The
    adapters are the path. A consumer that owns every `Diagnose` impl it renders may of course
    pre-size from its own counts — its trust decision about its own code, not advice tokora
    gives.

  Five adversarial shapes pin this in `tests/diagnostic_contract.rs`, across two fixtures: an
  early hole, an overcount, an undercount, a count that moves between calls through interior
  mutability, and a count of a million behind a single real label. The early hole and the moving count were each watched
  breaking `FusedIterator` before the fix — the recorded sequence was
  `[None, Some(Label { .. }), None, None, None]`; the early hole and the overcount were each
  watched breaking `ExactSizeIterator::len`; all four count shapes were watched advertising a
  positive lower bound, and the millionth watched `collect` answering `len=1 capacity=1000000`.
  The undercount breaks no marker law and is a characterization pin: the surplus item is
  unreachable and no adapter can learn it exists.

  Every method is required, with no defaulted accessors: a defaulted `label` or `path_segment`
  lets a family under-report *silently*, which compiles and renders and is simply missing
  labels. A genuinely new axis added later may ship defaulted, because impls written before it
  existed cannot answer it — that direction is safe, this one is not.

  tokora publishes the contract; it does not implement it for its own error types.

- **`impl From<emitter::Severity> for diagnostic::Severity`.** The crate now spells `Severity`
  twice and the two are not the same axis, so the relationship is a conversion rather than a
  coincidence. `emitter::Severity` is a *channel selector*: it decides which of a collecting
  emitter's two stores a record lands in, and `Fatal` reads it to decide whether to stop. It has
  exactly the two tiers that machinery has channels for, and it is not `#[non_exhaustive]`.
  `diagnostic::Severity` is a *reporting ladder* read after the fact by whatever renders the
  finished diagnostic, and it carries the third rung — `Advice` — that a deprecation or
  portability lint needs and that the emitter has no channel for.

  The emitter's two tiers embed into the ladder totally, so the conversion exists in that
  direction only. The reverse would have to answer which channel an `Advice` goes down, and the
  honest answer is that there is none.

  No consumer can already own this impl — both types are foreign to every other crate — so the
  one way it is observable is an `.into()` whose target was previously fixed by elimination and
  now has a second candidate. That fails loudly, at the call site, with an inference error.

- One `tokora::diagnostic` note that is a source comment rather than an API fact, recorded here
  because it will be re-litigated otherwise: `pub mod diagnostic;` in `src/lib.rs` deliberately
  carries **no outer doc comment**, unlike every other `pub mod` in that file. Rustdoc resolves a
  module's merged doc fragments in the scope of whichever attribute came from outside, so an
  outer comment there reinterprets every link in the module's own `//!` header as one rooted in
  the crate — measured at 20 `unresolved link` errors plus 2 `redundant explicit link target`
  under `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"`. The neighbouring modules get away with it because the names
  *their* headers link are re-exported at the crate root; this module's are not, and should not
  be, since `diagnostic::Severity` at the root would sit beside `emitter::Severity` for anyone
  doing a glob import. The crate index still shows the module's summary line, taken from that
  same header.

### Changed

- **The name-collision harness can now reach an owner that lives in a module the base ref does
  not have, and could not before.** `tokora::diagnostic` is the first WHOLE MODULE a diff has
  added, and that turns out to break `run.sh`'s `new-owner` verdict — which is granted only on a
  base-side diagnostic *naming this row's owner*. Every owner before this one lived in a module
  the base already had, so `use tokora::EmitterView;` failed as ``unresolved import
  `tokora::EmitterView` ``, with the owner in the message. Measured on `c14b936`, all three
  direct spellings report the **module** instead and never mention the type:

  ```text
  use tokora::diagnostic::Code;             -> E0432 `tokora::diagnostic`         (no `Code`)
  use tokora::diagnostic::*;                -> E0432 `tokora::diagnostic`         (no `Code`)
  impl .. for tokora::diagnostic::Code      -> E0433 `diagnostic` in `tokora`     (no `Code`)
  ```

  rustc suppresses the follow-on ``cannot find type `Code` `` in all three — correct compiler
  behaviour, and it left every one of the sixteen inherent rows scoring `INCONCL` while the head
  side was measuring exactly what it should. `gen_probe.py` now routes such an owner through a
  local re-export (`new_module_imports`), which splits the one failure into two and puts the
  owner in the second: ``unresolved import `new_module::Code` ``. The head side resolves both hops
  unchanged. **Any future diff that adds a module takes this shape**; a direct import of a type
  inside a new module cannot reach `new-owner` at all.

  The run over this branch's 50 probes is `PASS`: 16 `new-owner`, 33 `ok*`, one glob row
  rejected by the compiler, and no `SILENT`, `UNPROBED`, `INCONCL` or `FATAL`. The 33 are
  `Diagnose` and `DiagnoseExt`'s items, justified in `no_collision.txt` on one API fact — tokora
  implements neither trait for any type, so tokora's items are candidates on no receiver, and
  reaching them at all costs a consumer both an impl of their own and an import. That entry
  carries a re-open condition: the first tokora type to implement `Diagnose` replaces the record's
  receiver and the rows are re-probed.

  One bound found while doing it and left as it is, because nothing is lost by it: the harness
  identifies an owner by its **unqualified type name**, so `diagnostic::Severity::as_str` is
  absent from the inventory — masked by `emitter::Severity`, which already declares `as_str` on
  the base side. Its pick analysis is `Code::as_str`'s exactly (an owner no call site can
  predate), and a future item on it that `emitter::Severity` does not also declare will surface
  normally.

## 0.9.0 (2026-08-07)

### Source-breaking additions that can change behaviour with *no diagnostic at the call site*

This release adds **one** public name to a type that already shipped, and the two-sided
name-collision probe measures it **silent** in one of its two spellings. Disclosed here because a
consumer cannot discover it from a compiler diagnostic.

#### `Cst::resource_trips` — measured SILENT on a discarded return

**You are exposed if you wrote a `resource_trips` method of your own on
[`Cst`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/cst/struct.Cst.html)** — the handle both lossless
drivers return. It shipped with seven inherent items and no way to ask this question, so an
extension trait was the only way to carry the answer alongside the tree; that helper now competes
with a tokora method of the same name on the same receiver, and an inherent item wins the pick.

Reproduced two-sided by `ci/name_collision/`, base `543ce6d` against this branch, on
rustc 1.99.0-nightly:

```text
loud    resource_trips/used         base=witness=1  head=no-compile
SILENT  resource_trips/discarded    base=witness=1  head=witness=0
```

On the discarded row both sides compile, **neither emits any diagnostic**, and the two run
different programs: yours before, tokora's after. The `used` row is `loud` on the same probe
(`E0308` against the consumer's `-> u8`), so a **discarded return** is the whole of the
difference — `usize` carries no `#[must_use]` and `unused_must_use` does not fire on it, the same
discriminator every earlier silent row came down to. **The remedy is UFCS**:
`MyTrait::resource_trips(&cst)` pins your method by name and is immune to this.

`#[must_use]` was considered and rejected for the reason it was rejected for
`RecursionLimiter::unlimited`: it does not reach a consumer who *assigns* the result — the silent
case that matters, and the one the harness cannot generate — while firing on legitimate discards.
Disclosure is the honest instrument.

Recorded in `ci/name_collision/disclosed.txt`. It is disclosed on **this** branch because the
probe's inventory is a two-sided delta: once this merges the name exists on both sides, the row
leaves every future plan, and the harness can never re-litigate it.

**One template defect was found by the same run and is fixed with it, and the fix is not specific
to this name.** `gen_probe.py` bound its `Cst` subject immutably while generating every consumer
extension item with a `&mut self` receiver — so on a base side where the consumer's item is the
only candidate, the probe was `E0596` and never compiled. That is invisible for an owner the same
diff introduces, because there the base side is *expected* not to compile; it survived until the
first row on `Cst` with a real before-state, where it turned both spellings into `INCONCL`. The
binding is now `mut` (`drive()` already carried `#[allow(unused_mut)]`, so the reason it was
immutable had stopped applying), and the header of `INHERENT_SUBJECTS` now states that any further
row on `Cst` takes the pre-existing-owner shape rather than the seven original ones.

### Changed (breaking)

- **Every combinator family under `src/parser/` is now behind its own feature.** The umbrella
  `combinators` is a **default** feature, so a plain `tokora = "0.9"` compiles exactly the 0.8
  surface and nothing changes. A `default-features = false` consumer must now name the families
  it uses — either `combinators` for all of them or the individual ones:
  `any`, `fail`, `filter` (covers `filter_map`), `fold`, `ident`, `keyword`, `many`, `map`,
  `peek`, `pratt`, `punct`, `then`, `validate`.

  The point is footprint: an embedded or no-alloc build compiled all fourteen families whether
  or not the grammar named one. `many` alone is roughly 18,000 lines.

  Three edges are not guessable from the names and are encoded in the manifest:
  `fold` implies `many` (the folds route their absence exits through
  `many::absence_after_element`); `try_ident_list` needs `ident` **and** `many`; `list` and
  `separated1` need `many` on top of the allocator gate they already had. `punct` gates the
  punctuator *parsers* (`Comma::parse`, `parens`/`braces`/`brackets`/`angles`), not the
  `Punctuator` trait impls for the built-in markers, which stay unconditional because
  `delimited` and every `separated_by_*` read them. `pratt` reaches outside `src/parser/`: it
  also gates `token::PrattToken`, the token-level `InputRef::pratt*` driver, and the
  `PrattEmitter` channel with its emitter impls.

  What is **not** gated is the substrate: `Parser` / `Parse` / `parse*`, the `ParseInput`,
  `TryParseInput` and `ParseChoice` traits, and the top-level `src/parser/*.rs` combinators —
  `expect`, `delimited`, `recover`, `recovery_gate`, `select`, `opt`, `padded`, `node`,
  `skip_then_retry`, `ignore`, `labelled`, `empty`, `todo`, `with`, `by_ref`, `collect`,
  `accepted`, `unwrapped`. The families are written against those and the crate's own error,
  recovery and CST machinery names them, so a seam there would have nothing to stand on.

  docs.rs labels which feature every gated public item needs. Rustdoc derives that label from
  the item's own `#[cfg]` — the crate enables `#![cfg_attr(docsrs, feature(doc_cfg))]` and
  docs.rs builds with `--cfg docsrs` — so the punctuator markers' `parse` / `try_parse`, the
  `Ident` and `Keyword` parsers and the `InputRef` pratt drivers are labelled without carrying
  an attribute of their own. The explicit `#[cfg_attr(docsrs, doc(cfg(...)))]` the source does
  write is for the sites where the gate and the item are apart — the re-exports of a gated
  module's contents above all, where the label has to name the gate on the `pub use`.

- **The cache conformance kit now certifies whole cached *entries*, not spans — so a cache that
  certified under 0.8.0 can go red under 0.9.0, and that red is the kit seeing more, not a kit
  regression.** Every oracle in `tokora::conformance::cache` used to compare `L::Span` and
  nothing else: `front`, `back`, `pop_front`, `pop_back`, `peek`, `peek_one`, the token a refused
  push hands back, `push_many`'s overflow and the entry a `pop_front_if` predicate is given were
  all read through a projection that discarded the token and the `L::State`. A cache that
  returned the right spans while permuting or corrupting what sat beside them passed every check,
  in full — and 0.8.0 said so, in the kit's own *what it deliberately does not check* section.

  That was not a cosmetic hole. `L::State` is the half the input layer restores a lexer **from**:
  `InputRef::resume` reads the newest retained entry, clones its state and rebuilds the lexer with
  `Lexer::with_state` + `bump`, and the rollback path reads the same field off the entries
  `pop_back` hands out. A third-party cache with right spans and wrong states did not merely fail
  to be certified — it was certified, and then corrupted every restore that resumed from it.

  The kit's observable is now the triple `(L::Span, L::Token, L::State)`, compared componentwise
  wherever an entry, an entry reference or a peeked entry is read back, with a separate message
  per component so a failure says which of the three diverged. `Cache::span` stays span-valued,
  because a combined span is synthesized from two endpoints and has no entry behind it.

  Some values were read as *presence* rather than read at all, and that turned out to be the same
  hole one level down. Two of them mattered. The peek-mutate-peek driver — the only one in the kit
  that pops an instance it has already peeked — bound each popped entry, asserted it was `Some`
  and threw it away, which left the whole defect class alive on the peek-then-consume path the
  severity argument above rests on. And **every** push in the kit reduced its result to
  `is_ok()`, discarding the reference `push_back`/`push_front` promise on success: a cache can
  store the offered entry perfectly and hand back a reference assembled from a different resident,
  and nothing downstream can tell, because everything downstream reads storage.

  Enumerating the *shapes* a value arrives in — `Some`, `None`, `Ok`, `Err`-expected,
  `Err`-unexpected — turned out not to be enough, because a single call site can be two shapes at
  once: checks 3 and 5 each have one push whose refusal is sometimes legitimate and sometimes not,
  so an enumeration organised by shape classified them once and never saw the other branch. That
  is the same hole four review rounds in a row, each closed by hand and each followed by another.
  All five sites are closed here, and every read of a `Cache` return value in the kit now goes
  through one of a handful of comparing helpers, so the sites are few and each one's disposition
  is visible at the call. The enumeration is no longer one made by hand either: `CACHE_CALL_CENSUS`
  parses `conformance/cache.rs` and fails, naming the function and the line, when a call to an
  entry-returning `Cache` method appears at a site its table does not register. It earned that the
  moment it went in, catching two things the hand enumeration and its substring predecessor had
  both missed — locals named `back` and `front` read as function items, and two guarded calls in
  `assert_empty` sharing one anchor comment. Because `syn` parses rather than expands, the census
  also refuses any macro or attribute in that file that is not on a closed allowlist: a guarded
  call must appear *literally* in the source, so an unregistered one cannot arrive through an
  expansion the walk never sees. It is a test-only guard — no public surface changes with it, and
  `syn`/`proc-macro2` join `[dev-dependencies]` to serve it. Both are pure Rust, so the
  no-cc-rs-build-script rule that keeps the Miri matrix off macOS runners (#216) still holds.
  — *(#221)*

  The last of those sites was a **classification** error rather than a missed call, and it is
  worth stating because it is the shape the rest of this entry keeps circling. Check 9's
  false-predicate arm — `pop_front_if` driven with a predicate that declines — was filed among
  the kit's *absence is the law* exceptions and threw its predicate's argument away. For the
  arm's **return** that filing is right: `None` is the whole answer. But `pop_front_if` and
  `try_pop_front_if` are the only two `Cache` methods that run **caller code**, and they hand an
  entry over *before* they learn what to return, so a `None` says nothing about what the
  predicate was shown. A cache could keep storage conforming, decline correctly, leave residency
  untouched, and still run the caller's validation predicate against a token or an `L::State`
  from a position that entry never occupied — certified. Every arm that runs a predicate against
  a non-empty cache now records its argument and compares it. The two empty-cache probes stay
  absence-only on a different footing, stated where they live: their law is that the predicate
  must never run, asserted directly beside them, so on a conforming path nothing is handed to
  anyone.

  **Two compile-time breaks, for kit users only.** `CacheHarness` now requires
  `L::Token: PartialEq` and `L::State: PartialEq`. They sit on the harness and not on the `Token`
  or `State` traits, so no production implementor — and no logos `Extras` — is taxed to serve a
  test kit; the cost falls where the kit is used. Migration is to derive `PartialEq`, or to
  certify against a discriminating toy lexer, which is sound because a cache is generic over the
  entries it stores. Neither break can be silent: both surface as compile errors.

  **What the kit can and cannot discriminate is now stated exactly.** A substitution — an entry
  that differs from the one stored at that position — is always caught. A permutation of values
  that were already equal is not, so the discrimination is the pairwise distinctness of the tokens
  and the states *your corpus carries*. Spans are pairwise distinct from any source, so the
  ordering laws are unaffected; a single token variant with no payload, or a lexer whose
  `L::State` is `()`, makes that half of the comparison vacuous. A constant state is not a gap for
  that lexer — a single-valued state cannot be re-associated — but it is a gap for a cache
  intended for stateful lexers and certified under a stateless one, and `CacheHarness::new`'s docs
  now say so.

  Nothing outside the kit moves: `Cache`, `Lexer`, `State`, `Token`, `CachedToken`,
  `PeekedTokenExt` and the whole input layer are untouched, no public API is added, and
  `CachedToken` gains no `PartialEq` impl (the kit compares componentwise for the message quality
  that buys).

- **`CstEmitter::cst_start` now returns an `EventMark`, and a new `CstEmitter::cst_demote`
  spends it — the up-front node bracket.** `node(kind, p)` driven as a `ParseInput` used to
  name its node's kind *after* the sub-parse: entry minted an inert tombstone (`cst_mark`) and
  a successful exit retro-wrapped it (`cst_start_at` + `cst_finish`), three events per node.
  It now names the kind at entry (`cst_start`) and closes on both exits — `cst_finish` on
  success, `cst_demote` on failure — two events per **successful** node. Paired and
  interleaved with `apollo-parser` as the drift control, measured on the shipped append-only
  encoding described below: **−44.5 µs** median on the GraphQL `alias` corpus and
  **−315.2 µs** on a backtracking fixture, over 32 paired reps, 16/16 and 8/8 same-signed, no
  corpus slower. `alias` alone removes 9,013 events from a 64,085-event log.

  What breaks — two shapes, both in the emitter layer, none in a grammar. An emitter that
  **overrides** `cst_start` must now return the `EventMark` naming the slot it opened: a
  wrapper forwards the inner's value unchanged, and an emitter with no event channel should
  not override the method at all and inherits the defaulted inert mark. And **every**
  implementor now writes `cst_demote`, because it is a required method rather than a defaulted
  one — a wrapper forwards it, a diagnostics-only emitter discards it in one line. That is the
  next entry, and it is the half of this migration the compiler can point at. Grammars are
  untouched: `node`, `node_at` and `node_opt` are unchanged at their call sites, and the three
  surfaces that forward the event channel (`EmitterView`, `InputRef`, `ParseState`) carry
  `cst_demote` alongside the rest.

  What deliberately did *not* change: only `ParseInput for Node` took the up-front bracket.
  `TryParseInput for Node`, both `NodeAt` impls, `NodeOpt`, `cst_mark` / `cst_start_at` /
  `Marker` and the whole pratt driver stay retro, and they stay retro for a reason rather than
  by omission — a declining parser's kind is not knowable at entry (a decline must leave
  *nothing*, on a path that also consumes nothing), `node_at` exists precisely to name a kind
  decided after its first child, and a pratt wrap's kind is a function of an operator not yet
  read.

  The law it does **not** amend, and that is the point. `cst/event.rs` states that the
  parse-time event buffer mutates only by append and suffix-truncate. `cst_demote` obeys it: the
  failing exit **appends** an `Event::Demote` naming its own start, exactly as `cst_start_at`
  appends a `StartAt` naming its target, and materialization's canonicalization pass applies
  every surviving demote to its slot (`events[target].kind = TOMBSTONE`) at the one moment no
  live mark can exist — the sink has been consumed. Both of the bracket's exits are therefore
  appends, which gives them **one** rollback law: a session point rolled back into the window
  between a `cst_start` and its exit truncates that exit and the node is open again, success and
  failure alike.

  An earlier draft of this entry claimed an in-place kind rewrite was lawful without a journal
  entry. It is not, and the counter-example is why the encoding is what it is: a rollback whose
  target lands *between* the slot and the demote keeps the slot and keeps the rewrite, so
  `finish` returned a balanced buffer with one fewer node than the checkpoint promised —
  undetectable by anything downstream, on a history the public API can write (`EventMark` is a
  `Copy` POD and session points are non-lexical). The single-sentence law now covers all three
  interior writes the sink has: `cst_start_at`'s journaled `forward_parent` link, the recovery
  hole's splice floored above every live mark, and canonicalization.

  Canonicalization is **guarded by a latch**, and that is measured rather than tidy. It is one
  linear pass over the event log, and an unguarded pass costs a parse that never took a failing
  bracket exit — which is *every* parse of a predictive grammar, GraphQL included — a real
  `O(events)`: **+75 µs** median over eight paired reps on a 231 KB / ~220,000-event document
  whose demote count is exactly zero, 8/8 same-signed. The sink therefore carries a latching
  `demotes` hint, set when a `Demote` is appended and never cleared. It is in the `degraded`
  cell class rather than the memo class, and the direction of its imprecision is what makes it
  safe: nothing ever writes `false` after construction, so a rewind that truncates the last
  surviving `Demote` merely leaves the hint set and buys one no-op pass — the opposite error,
  which would let an abandoned node materialize, is unrepresentable, and a `debug_assert!` at
  materialization holds that direction.

  Four things this costs, stated rather than left to be discovered:

  - **A demoted slot is no longer a retro-wrap anchor.** It holds its real kind for the whole
    parse, so `cst_start_at` refuses the mark at its tombstone wall. The affordance was one PR
    old, unreleased and had no consumers; recovery tooling that wants to wrap an abandoned
    region takes its own `cst_mark`.
  - **A double demote is no longer refused in every build.** The slot is unchanged by a demote,
    so it cannot witness that it was already demoted — the same reason it cannot witness a
    finish. It drops to the calibration this surface already uses for demote-after-finish:
    caught at cause in a **debug** build by the exact suffix recount (a prior `Demote` is a −1
    above the mark), refused typed at materialization in **release** as
    `FinishError::StaleDemote`, through `finish` and `finish_partial` alike.
  - **A debug build now refuses two raw brackets whose closings *interleave*.** Because the
    demote is an event, demoting an *enclosing* start puts a −1 above an inner still-open slot,
    and the inner bracket's own demote then dips the recount. Release admits that order and
    materialises exactly the tree the innermost-first order builds — canonicalization is
    positional and tombstones both slots either way — so this is a **strictness choice on the
    raw surface, not detection of a release defect**: debug enforces innermost-first closings;
    release admits the out-of-order shape. No grammar can meet it, because `node` and `node_opt`
    mint and spend their mark inside one call frame and their exits nest structurally. Pinned
    from both ends: the emit-site refusal through the public surface, and the two closing orders'
    trees asserted byte-equal.
  - **The two brackets' error paths no longer leave byte-identical buffers — they
    *materialize* identically.** The up-front shape carries the demote event; canonicalization
    turns its slot into exactly the inert tombstone the retro shape left, before the walk begins.
    That is what the four-corpora byte-identity gate measures, and it still passes on all four.

  The rest of the misuse wall is unchanged and unconditional: a stale mark, a foreign sink's
  mark, a mark whose slot is not a live `StartNode` of the demoted kind, and a demote naming the
  reserved `TOMBSTONE` kind are all refused in **every** build. `FinishError::StaleDemote` is a
  new variant of a `#[non_exhaustive]` enum.

  **The stale-mark panic is not reachable from `node()`, and the wall that keeps it unreachable
  is now pinned.** A review round raised the shape it would take: a `SessionPointId` opened
  *before* the bracket, settled inside its inner parser, rewinding the sink below the bracket's
  own `cst_start` so the failing exit spends a staled mark and panics in a release build. At the
  sink the mechanism is real, and it is now driven directly through the raw surface, where it is
  the published contract. Through the combinator it does not compile: a settle needs an id whose
  `'closure` brand is **invariant**, and `ParseInput::parse_input`'s handle lifetime is
  universally quantified, so the id can enter neither direction of the unification. Two
  compile-fail cases pin it — the closure form and a hand-written `ParseInput` — because there
  is no runtime backstop underneath: `take_point`'s settle scan is newest-first and would
  *accept* a pre-bracket point, so the type system is the whole defence, and an untested
  type-system guarantee is one signature change away from silently ceasing to hold. The reading
  that this was a regression from the retro encoding does not hold either: under the identical
  drive the retro shape panics too, on its **success** exit, at the older `node_at` mark wall.
  The theorem, its three legs, and the duty it places on any future session-verb surface are
  written up in the `parser::node` module docs.

  One real gap did come out of that round, and it is closed. Canonicalization checked that a
  `Demote`'s target held a live, un-demoted `StartNode`, but not that the target sat **below**
  the demote itself. A raw-injected `Demote { target: 1 }` ahead of the start it named
  materialized a tree with that node silently erased — the only stale-demote shape whose residue
  stays balanced, so nothing downstream could catch it. One compare, before the slot read and in
  `u64` space (which also removes a latent 32-bit truncation alias, where a target past `2^32`
  wrapped onto a nearby slot), now refuses it as `FinishError::StaleDemote` through both finish
  doors. No legal stream is affected — the emission wall derives `target` from a validated live
  slot strictly below the appended event — and no accepted stream's output changes: the guard
  only converts invalid raw streams from accept to typed refusal.

  `cargo semver-checks` reports three lints here, all expected and acknowledged rather than
  suppressed: `trait_method_return_value_added` (`cst_start`'s return type changed on a public
  trait, above) and `trait_method_added` (`cst_demote` is a new **required** trait method,
  described in the entry below) are both intentional, and so is
  `enum_no_repr_variant_discriminant_changed` — inserting `FinishError::StaleDemote` above in
  declaration order, rather than appending it, shifts the fieldless discriminant of the
  fourteen variants after it. Nothing in the crate casts them and `FinishError` carries no
  `#[repr]`, so those values were never a contract. 0.9.0 is the vehicle for all three.

  The change costs a diagnostics-only parse **nothing, verified rather than asserted**: over
  `Fatal` / `Verbose` / `Silent` the event methods are `#[inline(always)]` no-ops — four
  inherited, `cst_demote` written out per emitter with the identical body — and the handback is
  a dead `Copy` constant; a fixture exercising the whole `node` family compiles to a
  **byte-identical binary** before and after — positive control, perturbing `cst_demote`'s body
  to a `black_box` changes it. The four-corpora tree-identity gate is byte-identical on all
  four, error corpora included.
  — *(#169)*

- **`CstEmitter::cst_demote` is a required method, not a defaulted one.** Every implementor
  writes it: a wrapper by forwarding to its inner, an emitter with no event channel with a
  one-line discard. The other four CST methods keep their no-op defaults, and that asymmetry is
  a rule rather than an inconsistency — it is stated once in the trait docs and it governs what
  may be added to this trait later.

  **Why.** The method arrived defaulted in the entry above, and the review round after it built
  the trap by construction: a 0.8-era wrapper that correctly forwarded all four CST methods
  fails its rebase onto 0.9.0 with *exactly one* diagnostic, `E0053` on `cst_start`, whose
  rustc fix-it writes the minimal migration itself and names `cst_demote` nowhere. Apply the
  suggestion and the wrapper compiles with zero warnings, is byte-perfect on every success
  path, and starves only the failing exit — the inner channel keeps a `StartNode` that no exit
  closes, on error paths, silently. A wrapper that was correct becomes incorrect with no change
  on its part, steered there by the compiler's own suggestion. Nothing downstream can recover
  it either: the starved stream is byte-identical to the one an escaped panic leaves, so strict
  `finish` refuses a grammar that did everything right (`UnclosedNodes`, misattributed) and
  `finish_partial` materializes the node the grammar retracted. There is no sink-side wall to
  build — the sink cannot tell a swallowed demote from a legal panic residue — which is why the
  wall is the type system.

  **Why only this one.** Grade each default by what happens when it is inherited alone over an
  otherwise-forwarded channel. `cst_start`, `cst_finish`, `cst_mark` and `cst_start_at` each
  fail toward an *absence* announced loudly on a path every test walks: `OrphanFinish` or
  `MismatchedFinish`, `UnclosedNodes` on the first successful parse, or the identity-wall panic
  in every build. `cst_demote` fails toward a *presence*, silently, through the door built for
  error recovery, on the paths test suites cover worst. `Emitter::commit_token` keeps its own
  default under this same test rather than in spite of it — its absence is loud and it has
  typed finish-time backstops (`StructureWithoutTokens`, `UncoveredGap`). So the rule, and it
  is the one that governs growth: **a method whose default cannot be backstopped and whose
  absence fails toward a silently wrong tree does not get a default.** A CST method added after
  this one either passes that test or ships behind a new bound.

  **Migration**, both populations, one line each:

  - *A wrapper or instrumentor* — forward it, exactly as it forwards `cst_start`:
    `fn cst_demote(&mut self, mark: EventMark, kind: u16) { self.inner.cst_demote(mark, kind) }`.
  - *An emitter with no event channel* — discard it:
    `fn cst_demote(&mut self, _: EventMark, _: u16) {}`. The shipped `Fatal`, `Silent`,
    `Verbose` and `Ignored` do exactly that, and the line is not noise: such an emitter really
    does discard the failing exit, and now says so where its own reviewer reads it.

  This lands the second half of the same migration in the same release. Both errors appear on
  one rebase, adjacent and self-explanatory: `E0053` with a fix-it, `E0046` naming the method.
  Deferring was not an option — after 1.0 a trait can only grow defaults, which is this trap
  again. Cost measured before the decision: four one-line stubs in the crate's own diagnostics
  emitters and one in the fuzz fixture; the recording `Sink`, the `&mut U` blanket and every
  in-tree wrapper already implemented it; no impls in the guide, the book, any doctest or any
  consumer in the org. `tests/ui/cst_demote_cannot_be_inherited.rs` pins the `E0046`, and its
  real subject is the future — the day someone re-adds the default "for convenience" that case
  starts compiling, and a `compile_fail` case that compiles is a failing test. It is the only
  signal there would be.

- **`rowan` moves from 0.16 to 0.17, and that is a breaking change for every consumer of the
  lossless tower.** `rowan` is not an implementation detail here: it is in tokora's *public
  API*. [`Cst::checkpoint`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/cst/struct.Cst.html) returns
  `rowan::Checkpoint`, `Cst::finish` returns `rowan::GreenNode`, and `cst::cast::token` returns
  `rowan::SyntaxToken`. Cargo treats 0.16 and 0.17 as incompatible majors, so a consumer that
  stays on 0.16 while tokora moves does not get a deprecation — it gets two `rowan` crates
  linked into one binary and type errors saying `GreenNode` is not `GreenNode`. **Bump both in
  the same commit.**

  It lands here rather than in 0.9.1 for exactly that reason: a public dependency's major is a
  breaking change, and 0.9.0 is the release allowed to make one.

  **One tokora API is removed with no replacement.** `rowan` 0.17 deletes the mutable red-tree
  API in full — `SyntaxNode::clone_for_update`, `new_root_mut`, `is_mutable`, `detach`,
  `splice_children` — along with the `sll` module that backed it. `cst::Node::clone_for_update`
  was a one-line forward to the first of those, so it is gone too. There is nothing to
  re-point it at. An edit is now a rebuild: read the green tree, emit a new one through
  `SyntaxTreeBuilder`, re-root it. `Node::clone_subtree` is **unaffected** — that is an
  immutable deep copy, it still exists upstream, and it is what most callers of
  `clone_for_update` actually wanted.

  `NodeChildren::by_kind` **keeps its exact signature and behaviour**. 0.17 also removed
  rowan's `SyntaxNodeChildren::by_kind` (and `first_child_by_kind`, `next_sibling_by_kind`,
  and the `by_kind` iterator types), so the filter is now applied in tokora instead of
  delegated. Same predicate, same comparison against `SyntaxNode::kind`, same yielded
  sequence — only the crate running the comparison moved.

  **This does not fix the `rowan` UB.** It would be easy to read a dependency bump as closing
  #235, and it does not. Measured on 0.17.0 with a two-site reproducer under both aliasing
  models: Stacked Borrows still reds in `arc.rs` (line 260 → 264, the `HeaderSlice` deref,
  whose body is byte-identical to 0.15.19's), and Tree Borrows still reds in `cursor::free`
  (line 219 → 136) when a red-tree `SyntaxNode` is dropped. Both sites moved line numbers and
  neither changed behaviour. The `rowan` Miri exclusion stays exactly as #235 recorded it.

  **No tool reported this break, and this paragraph is the whole of the warning.**
  `cargo semver-checks` 0.49.0 — the version the `semver-checks (advisory)` job pins — models
  **half** of what this entry describes, and after the version bump it models none of it. Run
  against the published 0.8.0 baseline while the manifest still said `0.8.0`, it reported four
  major failures, and exactly one belongs here: `trait_method_missing` on
  `Node::clone_for_update`, the removal above. The dependency major itself is **invisible** to
  it. `Cst::checkpoint`, `Cst::finish` and `cst::cast::token` have the same rustdoc-JSON
  spelling on both sides — `rowan::Checkpoint`, `rowan::GreenNode` and `rowan::SyntaxToken` are
  *paths*, and a path does not carry the version it resolved through — so the tool compares two
  identical signatures across an incompatible major and has nothing to say. Then the bump
  removes even the half it had: 0.8.0 → 0.9.0 *is* a major change for a `0.x` crate, so on the
  release commit the run is `0 checks: 0 pass, 253 skip` and `no semver update required`. The
  advisory job that has been red on `main` for this whole cycle goes green having executed not
  one check. A consumer who takes 0.9.0 and leaves `rowan = "0.16"` in place gets the two-crate
  link error described above, with no tooling anywhere on the path that would have told them.
  — *(#237)*

### Changed

- **MSRV raised to 1.95.** The previous floor, 1.87, was not a forced minimum — the crate
  still built on it — so this is a deliberate raise, not a reaction to a dependency or
  language requirement, and the policy note above `rust-version` in the workspace
  `Cargo.toml` is reworded to say so: the declared value is a floor maintainers set, not
  necessarily the crate's bare minimum. CI's `msrv` job now reads that declared value at run
  time instead of hardcoding a toolchain number, including for the toolchain-pinned
  `tests/diagnostics.rs` trybuild rail — its committed `.stderr` snapshots and `PINNED_RUSTC`
  move to 1.95 in this same change — so a future bump cannot leave either the job or the rail
  checking a stale version the way a hardcoded `+1.87` would have.

  1.95 stabilizes let-chains, and this is not a purely additive unlock: `clippy`'s
  `collapsible_if` is MSRV-aware, and the moment the declared floor reaches 1.88 it requires
  the let-chain form wherever a nested `if`/`if let` is collapsible. Nineteen pre-existing
  sites across eight files were written as nested `if`s specifically because the 1.87 floor
  did not have let-chains, several with a comment saying so — `cache/mod.rs`,
  `conformance/mod.rs`, `conformance/cache_tests.rs`, `cst/sink.rs`, `input/mod.rs`,
  `input/session.rs`, `input/input_ref/mod.rs`, and `input/input_ref/peek/mod.rs`. All
  nineteen are converted to let-chains in this same change (`cargo clippy --fix`, then
  `cargo fmt`, then a manual review of every hunk) — required by the new floor's own lint
  gate, not a stylistic pass. The three comments explaining the old avoidance are removed;
  they described a constraint that no longer exists once the code reads as a let-chain.
  Behaviour is unchanged: `cargo test --all-features` reports the same pass count before and
  after.

- **CI is two workflows now — `CI`, which is ubuntu-only, and `Miri`, which carries the two
  Miri matrices and the shard plan they depend on (#213).** Nothing is added, removed or
  reconfigured: the same jobs run, cell for cell, under the same check names, on the same
  hosts, with byte-identical steps. Only which workflow owns them changes.

  A run's conclusion is a property of the whole run, and that is what had stopped working. On
  2026-08-05 five consecutive `main` commits merged with no CI verdict at all — one run sat
  `queued` for 3h02m — while `loc` and `Deploy mdBook` completed on the same refs in the same
  window, so it was never an outage. The jobs themselves were mostly fine: in the run for
  `680d15f9`, 34 of the 59 completed within 49m49s of the run being created and 25 did not —
  the 24 Miri cells and `coverage` — so the 34 answers that did exist were unreadable. Two of
  them were red, on `main`, and stayed invisible. Splitting the macOS-bound half out means `CI`
  concludes on its own jobs, in tens of minutes, and `Miri` reports whenever its runners
  arrive.

  The line is drawn where the HOSTS are, which is not where #213 proposed drawing it: that
  issue expected the sanitizers and the cross matrix to be macOS-bound too, and they are not —
  both are `ubuntu-latest`, every one of their cells completed in the measured run, and they
  stay in the fast lane. The only macOS-bound cells in the repository are the 16 apple-darwin
  Miri cells, 8 per matrix, and that is the whole of the 269–347 minute macOS queue #157
  measured.

  Whether those cells need a macOS host at all was measured on a Linux host rather than
  assumed. Miri is not the obstacle: `cargo miri setup` builds a full darwin sysroot there in
  seconds, and with `criterion` dropped from the manifest the suite interprets and passes under
  both apple targets exactly as it does under the host's own linux target. What blocks them is
  `cargo build` — `criterion` is an unconditional dev-dependency, so cargo builds it for every
  `--test` target, and its transitive `alloca` runs a cc-rs build script that invokes the host
  `cc` with `-arch x86_64 -mmacosx-version-min=10.7`. That needs Apple clang and the macOS SDK.
  **That was then done, in the entry below, which supersedes this paragraph**: criterion is out
  of tokora's graph and none of these cells runs on macOS any more.

  Two `exclude` entries per Miri matrix went in the move. Each named a target absent from that
  matrix' own `target` list, so each excluded nothing while reading as though it did; the cell
  set is unchanged with them gone, and `actionlint` reports the workflows clean.

- **The benches are their own workspace member, `tokora-benches`, and with them goes the last
  macOS runner this repository asked for (#216).** The five `[[bench]]` targets and the
  `criterion` dev-dependency move out of `tokora/Cargo.toml`; `tokora-benches` is unpublished,
  depends on `tokora` by path, and the bench sources move verbatim — two doc-comment lines
  carrying a `cargo bench` invocation are the only edits to the 4,700 lines of them. No library
  code changes and no test changes.

  **Why a package boundary.** `criterion` pulls `alloca`, whose build script compiles
  `alloca.c` through cc-rs. Cargo resolves dev-dependencies per PACKAGE, not per target, so an
  unconditional `criterion` in tokora's `[dev-dependencies]` was built for *every* `--test`
  target — including under `cargo miri test --target x86_64-apple-darwin --test span`, where
  cc-rs hands the host `cc` an `-arch x86_64 -mmacosx-version-min=10.7` that only Apple clang
  and the macOS SDK can serve. Cargo has no optional dev-dependency, so there is no way to
  express this inside one manifest.

  **Measured in CI on a Linux runner before the fix was written** (runs `31081754960` and
  `31082043450`, branch `ci/miri-linux-probe-216`, `ubuntu-latest`), in four steps: `cargo tree`
  shows criterion is the only edge to `alloca`; `cargo miri setup` builds both darwin sysroots
  there in about fourteen seconds each; `cargo miri test --target x86_64-apple-darwin` exits
  **101** inside `alloca`'s build script on the `-arch` flag; and with that one manifest line
  deleted and nothing else touched, the identical command passes on **both** apple targets. So
  Miri was never what needed the host.

  **What changes in CI.** `miri.yml`'s two matrices lose their `os` axis and their three
  `exclude` entries each, and run every cell on `ubuntu-latest`. The cell set is otherwise
  identical — same three targets, same four shards, same `MIRIFLAGS`, same scripts, same 24
  cells plus the plan job — so this is a host change and not a coverage change. Repository-wide
  the macOS-bound job count goes from **16 to 0**; `ci.yml`, `pages.yml` and `loc.yml` were
  already ubuntu-only.

  **What it costs, and what pays for it.** A package boundary moves targets out of every
  command that names no package, and three of them mattered:

  - `clippy` linted the benches through a bare `--all-targets`. The workspace declares
    `default-members = ["tokora"]` — required, or `cargo miri test` at the root pulls criterion
    straight back in — so that line would have silently linted zero of the five. It carries
    `--workspace` now, verified off the `--message-format=json` stream: five `bench` artifacts
    with it, none without.
  - `bench (smoke)` no longer needs its hand-maintained
    `--no-default-features --features std,logos,rowan,unstable-raw,combinators`, because
    `tokora-benches` pins that feature point on its `tokora` dependency — which also means its
    bench targets declare no `required-features`, so the #181 failure (a bench whose features
    are unmet is *skipped*, not failed; the job once built one of five and reported `Finished`
    in ~30ms) is removed by construction rather than guarded against. The bare
    `cargo bench -p tokora-benches` that would replace it has its own silent shape — a deleted
    `[[bench]]` section is just a smaller job — so the step derives the target list from
    `cargo metadata`, passes each as an explicit `--bench NAME`, and refuses to run if it reads
    back fewer than five.
  - the `msrv` job compiled criterion on the pinned toolchain as a side effect of building
    tokora's test targets, and would have stopped. It now runs
    `cargo check -p tokora-benches --benches` there, which also compiles the five bench sources
    at the declared floor — slightly more than was covered before, not less.

  Two further edits are consequences rather than choices. `coverage` reads
  `--workspace --exclude tokora-benches`, so the measured package set stays exactly what
  `--workspace` meant when tokora was the only member. And `name-collision-probe`'s lock-parity
  guard exempted the literal name `tokora`; it exempts **path/local** entries now — the ones a
  lock records with no `source` — because a source-less entry's content is the working tree,
  which is the thing the two sides are already comparing, and the new member would otherwise
  have read as the two lock graphs disagreeing over this branch's own code. Every entry that
  carries a `source` is still compared exactly.

### Added

- **`Cst::resource_trips()` — a lossless consumer can finally ask whether the recursion budget
  tripped.** Both lossless drivers now carry the parse's descent-trip count onto the handle they
  return, and the new accessor reads it back. Purely additive: no signature changes, and both
  `parse_lossless` and `parse_lossless_partial` are covered.

  The gap it closes was measured, not inferred. A `parse_lossless` run whose parser trips the
  budget produced **zero diagnostics**, a tree that round-tripped byte for byte, and nothing at
  all saying why it was shaped that way. That is not an emitter oversight and is not fixed by
  routing the trip through one: `RecursionLimitReached` deliberately has no `emit_*` counterpart,
  because a recording emitter that could *absorb* a resource trip would be worse than one that is
  hard to observe — so the engines return trips rather than emitting them. Having refused the
  emitter channel, the crate offered nothing else. The one carrier was the driver's `Result`, and
  the realistic lossless consumer discards it: its product is the tree plus the diagnostics, so a
  descent trip was completely silent for exactly the consumer the lossless door exists for.

  The count could not simply be fetched afterwards. It lives on the parse-driver's `Input`, which
  `into_emitter` drops on the same line that mints the handle; `InputRef::recursion()` is public
  but **live-only** — it reports depth and limitation, never "a trip happened" — and the trip path
  releases the frame before building the error, so the budget reads clean the instant the error
  exists. The fix takes the counter at the one moment it still exists and moves it onto the value
  the consumer keeps.

  **Session-absolute, and only sound because the parse is over.** The cell is monotone: it counts
  up and nothing lowers it, because nothing can un-exceed a budget. Every site *inside* a parse —
  `recover`, `inplace_recover`, `skip_then_retry`, and the four resilient collection loops — reads
  it as a difference across the one attempt it is judging, since an absolute reading there would
  let one deep construct early in a document re-raise every later failure and suppress every later
  diagnostic. This accessor takes the absolute reading, and it is sound here for the reason it is
  unsound there: the parse is finished, so there is no later attempt to poison. It is a **count**
  rather than a `bool` for the same reason the cell is one — a grammar that catches a trip itself
  and parses on is supported, so more than one trip is reachable.

  What it does not report: *where* (a descent trip has a control stack rather than a position, and
  latches no boundary) and *whether the tree is truncated* (a grammar that caught the trip may have
  carried on). It answers the existence question, which a consumer holding a silent tree could not
  previously ask at all. A partial attempt builds a fresh input and therefore a fresh counter, so a
  `parse_lossless_partial` handle reports **that attempt's** trips, not a running total.

  Pinned in `tests/cst_resource_trips.rs`: both drivers, both directions, the value read off the
  handle before `finish` / `finish_partial` and unaffected by which door the tree comes out of, and
  the boundary stated as a **relation** — frames admitted equals the limiter's `limitation`
  exactly, so the deepest clean *nested-construct* count is `limitation - 1`, with `limitation`
  read out of the parse through `InputRef::recursion()` rather than written down, so a moved
  default re-points nothing.

- **An error-recovery example, and the pins that hold it — `examples/expr_recovery.rs` plus
  `tests/pratt_recovery.rs`.** tokora has always documented a recovery posture for the typed
  Pratt driver and demonstrated it nowhere: every grammar in this repository, every example and
  every census'd fixture aborts on the first error. This is the first in-tree grammar that
  parses malformed input to completion.

  It reproduces rust-analyzer's posture rather than rustc's, because continuing is what serves
  an editor. Missing left-hand side: report, and hand the driver a
  `PrattLHS::Operand(Expr::Error)` — a **zero-width** operand when the offending token belongs
  to a recovery set an enclosing construct can still use (`)`, an infix operator, end of input),
  a **one-token** one otherwise, which is r-a's `err_and_bump` and what keeps such a parse
  terminating. Missing right-hand side: the fold completes over the hole and **the loop
  continues**, so `1 + + 2` parses to `((1 + <error>) + 2)` with one diagnostic rather than two,
  and `+ 1 +` folds two operators and reports two problems. The grammar also shows the other
  half of the posture — a production that *cannot* repair what it found (an unclosed group)
  reports and returns `Err`, which crosses the driver on the keep-and-commit path and is caught
  by an `inplace_recover` boundary that resumes at the handback offset.

  It builds a rowan tree beside the AST, so the recovery is visible as structure: an `ErrorExpr`
  node sitting where the operand was owed, and `tree.text() == source` for every input including
  the malformed ones. The node has three widths, and which one appears is the observable
  difference between the three recoveries: **zero** when the offending token was left for an
  enclosing frame, **one token** when it belonged to nobody and was bumped, and **as wide as the
  offending text** for the third case — a literal the lexer accepted and `i64` cannot hold.
  `[0-9]+` bounds a digit run's shape and not its magnitude, so the value conversion is the one
  step in the grammar that can fail on a token nothing upstream is able to reject; it reports
  `NumberOutOfRange` and yields the same `Expr::Error` hole as the rest, because a parser that
  claims to have no failing input cannot have an operand arm that panics.

  It also documents **what does not recover**, which is the half an error-recovery example
  usually leaves out. A *grammar* error becomes a hole and the parse continues; a *resource*
  error ends it. There is one of the latter — the recursion budget, depth 64, which every nested
  group and every prefix `-` descends into. A trip is terminal **by design**: every recovery
  combinator, `inplace_recover` included, re-raises the attempt the trip stopped rather than
  spending it, because a budget a recovery point could swallow would not be a budget. The scoping
  is per **attempt** and not per session — the trip is counted on a monotone session cell, and
  each recovery point compares it against a baseline it took before its own attempt, so a grammar
  that catches a trip and parses on keeps ordinary recovery afterwards; this one catches it
  nowhere. So no error node can be
  synthesized and there is nothing to resume from. What `parse` owes there is not recovery but
  *not panicking*: the trip is recorded as `DepthExceeded` — deliberately a different variant
  from the never-should-happen `DriverContract`, so the corpus tripwire on the latter stays
  sharp — the root becomes a hole, and `Parsed::terminated` tells the caller which of the two
  happened. The lossless tree still round-trips, but only because a terminated parse is taken
  out through `Cst::finish_partial`, which tiles the un-parsed tail as one `Gap` run; the strict
  `finish` door refuses it with `UncoveredGap`, correctly, since for a parse that ran to the end
  an uncovered gap is a grammar bug.

  The 64 is tokora's default, not the example's choice, and the example says so: `parse_lossless`
  constructs its own `ParseContext`, so the one door to a caller-chosen budget —
  `ParserContext::with_recursion_limiter` — is not reachable from a lossless parse, and the
  plumbing cannot be hand-rolled either (`Cst::from_sink`, `Sink::finish` and
  `Input::into_emitter` are all `pub(crate)`). A lossless consumer that needs a different depth
  has no way to ask for one today.

  Nothing in the driver, the channels or any public signature changed to make this work — it is
  the existing surface used as documented, which was the point of writing it.

  The pins live in `tests/pratt_recovery.rs` rather than in the example's own
  `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`, because CI runs no example's test module (see the CI fix below).
  Fourteen cells, each written so a *shape* has to change for it to fail — exact ASTs, exact
  diagnostic lists with offsets, exact tree dumps and exact error-node byte ranges, never a bare
  count — plus a 48-input corpus asserting that no malformed input reaches the driver's terminal
  `UnexpectedEoLhs`/`UnexpectedEoRhs` arms and that every one of them round-trips.

- **Guide: recovery inside an expression.** A new section in
  [chapter 5](https://github.com/al8n/tokora/blob/main/tokora/src/guide/ch05_pratt.md) states
  the rule the posture rests on — only `PrattLHS::Prefix` is held to "consume what you report",
  so a zero-width `Operand` is legal — the recovery-set rule that keeps a recovering parse
  terminating, and where the two kinds of recovery meet. [Chapter
  8](https://github.com/al8n/tokora/blob/main/tokora/src/guide/ch08_recovery.md) gains the
  pointer from the other direction: it recovers *between* constructs, and an expression has no
  sync point inside it.

- **Two grouping pins in the C-expression example — prefix against postfix, and the ternary's
  right-associativity.** `examples/c_expression.rs` pinned `++x` and `x++` on separate rows and
  never together, and pinned `a ? b : c` but no nested ternary, so two groupings the driver
  decides were held by nothing: how the two increment forms bind around one infix operator, and
  whether a second `?` nests inside the first else-branch or sits beside it. Both are now
  asserted — `x++ + ++y` → `((x++) + (++y))` and `a ? b : c ? d : e` → `(a ? b : (c ? d : e))` —
  in the example's table, in the copy of that table inlined as doctests in [chapter
  15](https://github.com/al8n/tokora/blob/main/tokora/src/guide/ch15_c_expression_example.md),
  and as two more round-trip inputs in `examples/c_expression_cst.rs`.

  Both hold today; nothing in the driver changed. The second is worth a pin specifically because
  the grammar never declares it. The ternary is a *postfix* at `PREC_TERNARY` whose fold calls
  `parse_cexpr` for the else-branch — a fresh entry at `Power::default()`, not a floored
  recursion — so right-associativity there is a property of how the fold re-enters, and a pin is
  the only thing that says so.

### Fixed

1. **`is_empty()` was never asserted false by the cache conformance kit — a fixture returning
   `true` unconditionally passed `CacheHarness::run()` at every capacity the kit drives.**
   `is_empty` is a *default* `Cache` method (`len() == 0`) an implementation is free to override,
   and the kit called it from exactly one place, `assert_empty`, always against a cache `len()`
   had already established was empty. `assert_resident` — already run at every residency every
   other check sweeps, full and partially drained from both ends — now also checks
   `is_empty() == want.is_empty()`, so a constant answer is caught the first time the kit drives
   a non-empty cache instead of never.
   — *(#180)*

2. **`clear()` and `span()` had the same one-shot blind spot in the cache conformance kit, in
   two different shapes.** `check_clear` filled a cache, cleared it, asserted the check-1
   invariants, and never touched it again — so a `clear` that empties the cache and also
   **permanently disables it** (refuses every push afterward, with capacity to spare) passed
   exactly like one that only empties it. It now refills the cleared cache with `cap` fresh
   pushes and checks the refill against check 3's oracle. Separately, `assert_empty`'s own pop
   probe called `pop_front`/`pop_back` on a throwaway `C::new()` rather than on the cache
   `check_clear` had just emptied, so neither call site actually asked the CACHE UNDER TEST
   whether its own pops still answered; `assert_empty` now takes that cache by `&mut` and probes
   it directly.

   `check_span` called `span()` exactly once, immediately after a fresh fill — a residency at
   which `span()` cannot yet be stale, so a `span` that is correct there and never updated after
   a `pop_back` passed unnoticed. It now sweeps every residency `peek`'s check already sweeps:
   full, and partially drained from both the front and the back.
   — *(#180)*

3. **`pop_front_if`/`try_pop_front_if`/`push_many` were never called by the cache conformance
   kit, so a broken override of any of the three passed `CacheHarness::run()` unnoticed.** All
   three are *default* `Cache` methods composed from `front`/`pop_front`/`push_back` — already
   checked exhaustively — so an implementation that does not override them was already correct.
   What was untested was an override: one that removes on a false predicate (or removes and
   reports `None` regardless of what the predicate said), or one that silently discards tokens
   that do not fit instead of handing them back through `push_many`'s overflow iterator. The kit
   now drives both `pop_front_if` and `try_pop_front_if` against a false predicate, an
   `Err`-returning one, and a true/`Ok(())` one, on both an empty and a filled cache, and drives
   `push_many` with two more tokens than capacity, checking the accepted prefix and the refused
   overflow separately.
   — *(#180)*

4. **`peek_one` was never called twice against one unchanged cache by the cache conformance
   kit, so an answer that is correct once and wrong on every repeat passed
   `CacheHarness::run()`.** `peek` has been held to that law since the kit existed; `peek_one`,
   which is composed from it, had not — the kit called it exactly once per residency its sweep
   visits, against a cache instance built fresh for that residency, so a second answer had
   nothing to disagree with. It is now called twice at every one of those residencies.
   Separately, the assertion that `peek_one` names the front entry had **no mutant behind it at
   all**: `peek_one` is a default method, no fixture had ever overridden it, and a fixture that
   does not override it is correct wherever `peek` is. Both halves now have one.
   — *(#180)*

5. **`front()` and `back()` were checked for presence and never for identity outside the empty
   state, so a cache whose specialized span accessors were right and whose entry accessors were
   wrong passed the cache conformance kit.** `assert_resident` — the oracle every residency check
   in the kit runs through — read `front_span()`/`back_span()` and nothing else, and nothing
   required the two pairs to name the same entry. `front_span`/`back_span` are *default* methods
   derived from `front`/`back`, so a cache that gets only `front` wrong was already caught; what
   was not is a cache that specializes the span accessors off a head and tail index, which is
   what a ring does to avoid building a `CachedTokenRef`, and then disagrees. The entry is the
   half that carries the token and the `L::State` a restore resumes from. `assert_resident` now
   reads `front()`/`back()` themselves against the same expectation.
   — *(#180)*

6. **`Cache::with_options` was never called by the cache conformance kit, so a conformant `new()`
   covered for an arbitrarily broken second constructor.** `Cache` has two constructors and the
   kit built every cache it tested with the first, so a `with_options` that came back non-empty,
   or that reported a capacity it would not honour, passed `CacheHarness::run()` undetected. The
   kit could not reach it on its own: `Options` is an associated type it has no way to fabricate
   a value of. `CacheHarness::also_built_by(|| C::with_options(..))` is the new, additive way to
   supply the second constructor; `run()` then drives the **whole** contract a second time
   against caches built by it, re-reading the capacity per pass so the two may differ, and every
   failure message names which constructor built the cache it is about. tokora's own four caches
   are now driven through both. What no kit generic over `C` can check — that the capacity
   matches what the *caller asked for*, since `Options` is opaque — is stated in the module docs'
   "what it deliberately does not check" section rather than left implied.
   — *(#180)*

7. **The cache conformance kit's `push_front` check returned at its first line for capacity 1,
   so the one capacity at which every front push is refused was never driven at all.** The
   prepend *order* genuinely is not observable there — the seeding `push_back` fills the cache,
   so nothing can be prepended — but the refusal is, and nothing else in the kit reaches a
   refused push on that arm: check 3 drives the round-trip for `push_back`, and the two checks
   that drive accepted front pushes never see one refused. A cache that corrupts a refused
   `push_front` — hands back a resident entry and swallows the token it was offered — was
   therefore invisible at capacity 1, which is precisely the capacity where every front push is
   refused. Check 5 now returns only at capacity 0, and asserts at capacity 1 that the refusal
   half was actually reached.
   — *(#180)*

8. **No cache instance was ever peeked, mutated, and peeked again by the cache conformance kit,
   so a `peek` that memoises its first answer passed `CacheHarness::run()`.** The residency sweep
   reaches every state a cache can be in, but it reaches each of them on a cache built **fresh**
   for it — fill to capacity, pop to the depth wanted, and only then peek — so every `peek` the
   kit ever made was the first question that instance had been asked, and the latch was always
   armed by the very state it was about to be checked against. Such a cache also satisfies the
   purity law, which was the only repeatability the kit asked for: two peeks with nothing changed
   in between *do* agree; a latch is only wrong once something has changed. Check 6 now runs its
   whole body once more against a single instance, peeked at capacity and then popped and
   re-peeked at every residency down to empty, alternating which end the pop comes off.
   — *(#180)*

9. **The cache conformance kit built every mixed residency the same way and read it from the
   same end, so two whole dimensions of the prepend law went undriven.** A residency a
   `push_front` contributed to was drained with `pop_front` and never from the other end, and
   every `pop_back` the kit *did* drive — check 4's newest-first drain, check 6's and check 8's
   back sweeps — ran against a cache `push_back` filled from empty. A `pop_back` that is correct
   on a back-built residency and wrong on one a prepend built, which is a ring whose prepend
   establishes the new head and leaves the tail index naming a slot it invalidated, therefore had
   nothing to answer to — and that is the shape the input layer's **restore** path reads through
   after a put-back has prepended. Separately, every mixed residency was "one `push_back`, then
   N `push_front`s", so in the whole kit an append **never once followed** a prepend: a
   `push_back` that computes its slot from a head index a `push_front` has since moved was
   correct in every sequence the kit could build. Check 5 now drains each front-built prefix from
   both ends, and drives a second residency built by **alternating** the two arms from empty,
   swept from two entries up to the capacity.
   — *(#180)*

10. **The cache conformance kit peeked through one window type, `U4`, in every driver it had — so
   a `Cache::peek` that reads `W::CAPACITY` off its own type parameter and branches on it was
   invisible.** `peek` is generic over the window, and the two natural branches on it are both
   dead code at a single fixed one: the single-slot fast path the trait itself invites, since
   `peek_one`'s default body is literally `peek::<U1>` into a one-slot buffer, and the truncating
   path a cache takes when the residency does **not** fit in the window, which never runs while
   the window is at least as wide as every residency the kit builds. Sweeping the prefill depth
   was not a substitute: that varies the buffer's remaining capacity, not the type. Check 6 now
   reads the bound, the order and the purity law through `U1` and `U3` as well as `U4`, at every
   residency it already sweeps.
   — *(#180)*

11. **No residency the cache conformance kit built could make a ring wrap, so the classic missing
   `% capacity` was truncating by zero everywhere the kit asked.** The kit fills by pushing back
   into an empty cache, which puts a ring's head at slot zero, and every state it reached from
   there was reached by popping: popping the front advances the head and shortens the run by the
   same step, so `head + len` never exceeds the capacity, and popping the back only shortens it.
   A live run wraps past the end of the backing array only when something is **pushed after
   something was popped**, and no driver in the kit did that. Both operations that *walk* from the
   head — `peek`, and the combined `span` — were therefore never asked to cross the seam. Checks 6
   and 8 now re-run against a rotated residency: drained off the front and topped back up to
   capacity, swept across head positions up to the peek window's width. (`front`, `back` and the
   pops name a single slot rather than walking to one, and an index naming the wrong slot is
   already caught by the residency oracle, so those are not re-driven.)
   — *(#180)*

12. **Every prefilled `peek` the cache conformance kit drove put entries in the buffer whose spans
   came *after* the residency — the inverse of what the input layer actually hands over.**
   `InputRef`'s peek fill pushes the parked token before it calls in, because the parked token is
   the front of the stream: it heads the window and the cache fills in behind it. So at the real
   call site the buffer holds what comes **first**, and the kit had never once built that shape.
   That is the one arrangement in which a cache can talk itself into treating the buffer as a
   prefix of its own run and skipping an entry it decides the caller already holds — a "do not
   serve the parked token twice" dedup, keyed on a span comparison that is simply false in the
   arrangement the kit did build. Check 6 now sweeps the prefill depth in **both** relations,
   building the residency one peek window into the corpus so the tokens before it are available
   to prefill from; this costs no extra source, since the kit already asks for the capacity plus a
   window.

   Recorded because the issue this closes predicted the opposite: it named a `peek` that *sorts or
   merges by span* as the invisible case. That one is caught, and was already — measured, not
   argued. Because the old prefill's spans are the greater ones, a correct append leaves the
   buffer **unsorted**, so any sort visibly reorders it and the untouched-prefix assertion fires
   at depth 1. In the newly added relation the correct append is already ascending, so a sort is
   the identity and invisible there. The two arrangements catch different defect classes, which is
   why both are kept.
   — *(#180)*

13. **The cache conformance kit's check 9 said "the predicate sees the front entry" for both
   `pop_front_if` and `try_pop_front_if`, and had no way to tell for either: the two
   `try_pop_front_if` closures threw the entry away, and the `pop_front_if` one that kept it had
   never been run against a cache that disagrees.** The Err closure was `|_| Err("no")` and the
   Ok closure `|_| Ok(())`, so everything the check asserted about `try_pop_front_if` was its
   return value and its residency. An override that ran the caller's validation predicate against
   `back()` and then handed back the error, or removed and returned exactly the front — the
   conforming outcomes — satisfied every one of those assertions and was certified. That is a
   cache whose caller-supplied predicate decides whether to keep or drop the front token on the
   strength of unrelated lookahead, and a parser built on it removes or retains the wrong token.
   Both predicates now record the span they are handed and assert it is the front entry's, ahead
   of the return and residency assertions that were already there.

   The sweep that followed found the same shape one arm over. `pop_front_if`'s recording assertion
   has existed since the check was written, but every fixture predicated on `front()` — including
   the one whose entire defect is in `pop_front_if`, which gets the *return value* wrong and the
   question right — so that assertion had never fired in its life. An assertion with no mutant
   behind it is the defect class this issue exists to close, not an exception to it, so it now has
   one. Two new cells, one per method, each handing its predicate the back entry while keeping the
   return value and the residency conforming. The `try_pop_front_if` one is invisible to the kit
   as it stood — the whole suite runs green against it; the `pop_front_if` one is the witness its
   assertion never had. Removing the assertion that catches either reds exactly that one test and
   nothing else.
   — *(#180)*

14. **The docs.rs build was broken, and no gate in the workspace could produce the failure.** Ten
    `#[cfg_attr(docsrs, doc(cfg(...)))]` attributes sat on **block expressions** rather than on
    items — the inner `{ ... }` of an anonymous const, in `container`, `parser::many::handler` and
    the three `state` trackers. Under `--cfg docsrs` rustdoc rejects each one as an unused doc
    comment, which the crate's own `#![deny(missing_docs, warnings)]` turns into an error, so
    `RUSTDOCFLAGS="--cfg docsrs -D warnings" cargo +nightly doc --all-features --no-deps` exited
    101 while every other gate was green. `doc(cfg)` is **inert without `--cfg docsrs`**, and both
    doc legs in `ci.yml` ran without it, so the attributes never expanded and never warned —
    while docs.rs, which builds *with* it, is where the fault actually lands.

    The fix is the shape two of the three siblings in `state/tracker/mod.rs` were already written
    in: `const _: () = { ... };`, an item, in place of the bare block. That is not cosmetic. The
    attribute was being dropped, so the badges it exists to render were missing: the `Tracker`
    impls for `logos_0_14` carried no "Available on crate feature" label while their `0_15` and
    `0_16` neighbours did, and the `TinyVec` container and separator/delimiter handlers were
    labelled `tinyvec_1` alone instead of `tinyvec_1 and (alloc or std)`. All of them render now.
    No `#[cfg(...)]` changed and no configuration compiles differently.

    A third doc leg builds documentation the way docs.rs does — `--cfg docsrs` on nightly, deny
    warnings — so the next misapplied attribute is found before publish rather than after.
    — *(#195)*

15. **`cargo hack --each-feature` never builds a feature PAIR, so every `all(A, B)` cfg was
    compiled in exactly one leg — `--all-features`, where a third feature can supply whatever the
    pair itself was missing.** The matrix runs `--no-default-features`, each of the 40 features
    alone, and `--all-features`: 42 legs, never a proper subset of size two or more. That is
    coverage-shaped and is not coverage — downstream in smear the same hole let a `rowan +
    graphqlx` pair fail from the commit that introduced it with green CI on every run in between.

    Three legs now build combinations the matrix cannot reach, and they are derived from the cfgs
    that exist rather than from the feature list: `fold,alloc` — the only leg compiling the
    `many`/`fold` family at the alloc-without-`std` tier — plus `std,logos,combinators --tests`
    and `std,logos,trace --tests`, which between them carry eight predicates over 34 sites that no
    other leg satisfies. The third names `logos`, not `logos_0_16`, because `cfg(feature = "…")`
    matches the literal feature name and only the umbrella satisfies both
    `all(std, logos_0_16, combinators)` and `all(test, logos, std, combinators)`.

    Hardcoded legs are a snapshot, so `ci/feature_cfg_coverage.py` enumerates every multi-feature
    `cfg` in `tokora/src/` and fails, naming the predicate and a site, when no leg builds a
    configuration satisfying it. `--all-features` is deliberately not counted as a covering leg:
    it satisfies everything, which is the blind spot being closed. CI does not repeat the leg
    list — it asks the script to print it and runs what it prints. The scan is attribute-based
    and multi-line aware, which is load-bearing: the line-oriented grep the original derivation
    used reported 25 predicates over 210 sites, the attribute scan finds 29 over 317, and one
    predicate visible only to the latter — `all(test, trace, any(logos_0_16, logos_0_15,
    logos_0_14), std)`, rustfmt-wrapped over five lines — was reachable from no leg at all.
    `ci/feature_cfg_coverage_selftest.sh` plants an uncovered predicate, deletes each
    load-bearing leg in turn and staleness-flips the leg declarations, requiring a red from each.
    — *(#200)*
16. **A recovery hole reported with a span reaching back over already-committed tokens spliced
   its error node *below* a live checkpoint mark, silently corrupting the CST event log in
   release builds.** The CST sink's checkpoint marks are event-buffer positions and the hole wrap
   is an `insert`, so a wrap start below a live mark shifts every index at or above it and the
   mark comes to name a different position. The wrap's `Start` then sits below the mark and its
   `Finish` above it, so the rewind that follows truncates between them: the log keeps an
   unbalanced error start where a committed token used to be. Only a `debug_assert!` stood
   against it, so the profile users ship had no wall at all — a debug panic and a release
   corruption from the same call.

   Nothing in the crate's own recovery could reach it: `sync_balanced` spans exactly the tokens
   its scan just settled, which postdate every capture. The reachable door is a caller running
   its own recovery loop through `InputRef`, `EmitterView` or `ParseState::emit_skipped_region`,
   where the span is the caller's own and no public surface stated any discipline relating it to
   open checkpoints — the realistic trigger being a lossless grammar whose recoverer widens its
   reported span backward over adjacent committed trivia.

   The wrap start is now **bounded** rather than asserted: the backward scan is floored at the
   youngest positional fact the sink holds — the innermost live mark-stack row, or the released
   floor memo when a commit promoted it higher — so the splice cannot cross one by construction.
   Fixing up the shifted rows instead is not available: every truncation point between a `Start`
   below a mark and a `Finish` above it tears the pair, and no row arithmetic restores
   rewind-exactness. The `debug_assert!` is gone rather than promoted, because the clamp is now
   the contract and an assert that fires on behaviour release defines-and-accepts is the
   profile divergence this crate has been removing.

   A wider caller span still reaches the diagnostic channel verbatim; only the error node it
   induces is narrowed, to the tokens that settled within the transaction reporting the hole.
   That span semantics is now stated on all four public doors and on the sink's own impl.
   — *(#177)*

17. **Nothing distinguished a correct forwarding method from a mis-wired one.** `EmitterView`,
    `InputRef`'s emit surface and `ParseState` carry a thin delegation layer onto the emitter's
    operations, written by copy-and-adjust. A body that reached a *sibling* — `emit_warning`
    calling `emit_error`, `cst_finish` calling `cst_start` — compiled, propagated nothing, and
    passed the whole suite; the defect surfaced only as the wrong diagnostic in a consumer's
    output, arbitrarily far from the cause. Demonstrated rather than asserted: re-pointing
    `InputRef::emit_missing_leading_separator` at `emit_missing_separator` produced **zero**
    failures anywhere in the crate.

    `tests/forwarding_discrimination.rs` covers every public method of all three receivers, one
    test each, and each one asserts the specific call landed on the inner emitter with its
    arguments unchanged — not that the method ran. The instrument is a recording emitter that
    logs a tagged call per operation, including the five members the surface deliberately
    withholds, so a forward that lands on `commit_token` is visible too. The three existing
    recorders could not do this: `Verbose` funnels eleven capability channels into one error
    channel and its `CstEmitter` impl records nothing, and the tracking and counting emitters
    hold plain counters.

    The suite is proven discriminating: six sibling re-pointings each red exactly the delegation
    closure of the mutated body and nothing else — one test for a `ParseState` leaf, two when an
    `InputRef` body has a `ParseState` twin above it, three for an `EmitterView` body with twins
    at both layers. A `FORWARDING_CENSUS` test reads the three sources and fails when a method
    gains or loses a row, so the coverage cannot drift.

    Two findings came out of building it. Most sibling re-pointings **do not compile** — the
    method-level capability bounds mean `emit_missing_leading_separator` cannot reach
    `emit_missing_trailing_separator` at all — so the reachable mis-wire space is exactly the
    identical-signature families the suite now pins. And `Emitter::bound_source` is not only a
    query: the parse entry compares it against the buffer it was handed and refuses a mismatch,
    so an emitter that answers `Some` for anything but the parse's own source cannot be driven
    through a parse. — *(#179)*

18. **The `logos parity (0.14, 0.15)` CI job never compiled or ran the cache conformance kit
    (`tokora::conformance::cache_tests`) under either version it exists to check.** The kit's
    fixture lexer is a real `logos::Logos` derive — the most version-sensitive file in the
    crate — but the job's command line named `std,combinators,${{ matrix.logos }}` and never
    `conformance`, so the one job whose entire purpose is cross-version parity was the one job
    that skipped the module most likely to diverge across versions. Every other leg that
    reaches the kit uses `--all-features`, which always resolves the crate's `logos` alias to
    `logos_0_16`, so in practice the kit had only ever been exercised against one of the three
    advertised majors. `conformance` is now named alongside `combinators` in both matrix legs.

    The same audit found two source-level instances of the same mistake, neither reachable by
    any CI feature combination until fixed at the source: `parser::select_tests` and
    `tests/wapi_b.rs` were gated on the `logos` feature alias — which always means
    `logos_0_16` — instead of `any(logos_0_16, logos_0_15, logos_0_14)`, the form every
    sibling module that builds a `Logos` derive uses. Both trace to the same pull request; a
    later audit in the same series fixed one sibling, `select_tests`'s neighbour
    `terminal_stop_tests`, and missed these two. Both now use the `any(...)` form and run
    under all three versions like the rest of the suite.
    — *(#208)*

19. **Three gates were red on `main` for two commits, and the run holding two of the three
    verdicts never concluded, so nothing surfaced them.** `CI`'s Miri cells sit queued for
    hours while the other 34 jobs finish in under an hour; a run's conclusion stays `null`
    until the last cell reports, and `gh pr checks` and the run-level status show nothing in
    the meantime. Both `feature combinations` and `name-collision-probe` had already answered.
    Read job conclusions, not run status, until #214 lands.

    **`feature combinations`, third leg.** `tests/forwarding_discrimination.rs` gated its
    `state_case!` **definition** on `map` — correctly, since the macro's body spells
    `.map_with(...)`, the only door to a `ParseState` — and left the twelve **invocations**
    ungated. A `#[cfg]`'d-out `macro_rules!` does not expand to nothing, it ceases to exist,
    so `--no-default-features --features std,logos,trace --tests` failed with twelve
    `cannot find macro state_case` rather than twelve quietly absent rows. The twelve
    invocations now carry `#[cfg(feature = "map")]`, which is what every other item in that
    section already carried. Coverage is unchanged where it is measured: 69 tests before and
    69 after under `--all-features`, and the FORWARDING_CENSUS row count over the three
    receivers is still 27 + 25 + 17.

    Making that leg compile also made its warnings reachable, and it arrived with eight
    `never used`: the FORWARDING_CENSUS section gates its `#[test]` on `pratt` but not the six
    constants and two functions that serve only that test, nor the `BTreeSet` import they need.
    All ten now carry the same gate, so the leg is warning-free rather than merely green.

    `required-features` on the test target was rejected: it **skips** a target instead of
    failing it, which converts this red into a silently unrun suite — the defect class #181
    was filed for, where `bench (smoke)` compiled one of five targets and stayed green.
    Widening the macro's own gate was rejected too: the body needs `map` to type-check at all,
    so the gate is not incidental.

    **`name-collision-probe`.** The job's lock-parity guard — every `[[package]]` triple must
    match across head and base, so a collision finding cannot be an artifact of two `cargo doc`
    runs linking different versions of a third crate — fired on `b8773b80` with
    `only in base: trybuild 1.0.119` / `only in head: trybuild 1.0.120`. That is a real
    resolution difference and the guard was right to see it, but nothing about the dependency
    graph had changed: since cargo 1.84 the resolver holds a dependency back when its
    `rust-version` exceeds the workspace's, trybuild 1.0.120 declares 1.88, and the MSRV bump
    in that very commit took the workspace from 1.87 to 1.95 — admissible to head, held back
    on base. The resolved graph was a function of a manifest field the two sides are not
    required to share, which is the same reason the job already resolves its FEATURE point per
    side rather than handing one list to both. Left alone it would red every future MSRV bump
    and its PR.

    The inventory step now runs both `cargo generate-lockfile` calls under
    `CARGO_RESOLVER_INCOMPATIBLE_RUST_VERSIONS=allow`, so `rust-version` is not an input to
    either resolution and the only inputs left are the dependency requirements — which is what
    the comparison is asking about. The guard itself is untouched: relaxing it to tolerate
    version-only differences would have let a genuine dependency swap through on exactly the
    pull requests that also move the MSRV.

    **`Deploy mdBook to GitHub Pages`.** `pages.yml` carried `RUST_TOOLCHAIN: 1.88.0` in its
    `env:`, and the MSRV raise to 1.95 updated the pin in `ci.yml` only, so every push and
    every pull request failed *Run guide doctests* with
    `rustc 1.88.0 is not supported: tokora@0.8.0 requires rustc 1.95`. Writing `1.95` there
    would reproduce the defect one bump later, so the workflow now reads `rust-version` from
    `Cargo.toml` at run time exactly as the `msrv` job does, loud guard included: an empty read
    fails the job rather than falling through to `cargo +""` and testing the guide on whatever
    rustc the runner happened to ship. Every workflow under `.github/workflows/` was swept for
    the same shape — `ci.yml` reads the manifest or installs floating `stable`/`nightly`,
    `loc.yml` installs floating `stable`, and the `ci/*.sh` helpers install floating `nightly`
    — and `pages.yml` held the only hardcoded toolchain version left.
    — *(#215)*

20. **The pages workflow's "Compile canonical examples" step compiled no example, and exited
    0 while doing it.** It ran `cargo test -p tokora --no-default-features --features
    std,logos --examples`. Every `[[example]]` in the manifest declares `required-features`
    that include `combinators` — and the `_cst` twins need `rowan` on top of it — so that
    feature set filtered out all eight targets that then existed and cargo reported `target
    filter 'examples' specified, but no targets matched; this is a no-op`, which is a
    **warning**. The step was green for as long as it existed and checked nothing; an example
    that stopped compiling would have been caught only by `cargo test --all-features` building
    it, and an example's assertions were never executed anywhere, because `cargo test` does not
    run an example's `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` unless `--examples` is passed. The feature set is
    now `std,logos,rowan,combinators`, which matches all **nine** examples in the manifest —
    the eight plus `expr_recovery`, added in this release, whose `required-features` are the
    same four — and runs each one's `test_example` cell.

    Note the failure mode is specific to `--examples`, which is a target *filter*: an
    unsatisfiable one matches nothing and warns. `cargo run --example NAME` names a target, so
    an unsatisfiable feature set there is a hard error, which is why the run commands in the
    example headers could never have hidden this.

    This is the class the repository has been bitten by before — a target *skipped* rather
    than failed — and it is why the recovery example added in this release keeps its pins in
    `tests/pratt_recovery.rs`, which `cargo test --all-features` runs unconditionally, rather
    than relying on this step.

21. **No CI job had ever linted an example, and four of them were red on `main`.** The `clippy`
    job ran `--tests` and then `--benches`, and neither flag reaches an example: `--tests`
    selects the targets carrying `test = true`, which an example does not, and `--benches`
    selects `bench = true`. Counted off the `--message-format=json` artifact stream rather than
    inferred from the flag names, `--tests` processes 105 tokora targets and `--benches` 7 — the
    lib, the build script, the 103 integration tests and the five benches — and zero of the
    eight in `examples/`. So `cargo +stable clippy --all-features --all-targets --no-deps --
    -D warnings` exited **101 on `main`** while the job reported green: `calculator_cst`,
    `s_expression_cst`, `json_cst` and `c_expression_cst` each pass `Default::default()` as
    `parse_lossless`'s `L::State`, which for a `LogosLexer` whose token enum declares no logos
    `Extras` is a unit value, and passing a unit value to a function is `clippy::unit_arg`. The
    four now spell `()`, which is what the driver's own rustdoc example has always used, and the
    job runs a single `--all-targets` line in place of the two: 118 targets, the union of the old
    pair plus exactly the eight examples, with the lib checked once instead of twice.

    The same idiom sat in ten more places the new line cannot reach — the `parse_lossless` calls
    in `guide/ch16_lossless_cst.md`. **Doctests are the one declared target kind clippy cannot
    lint**: `--all-targets` excludes them by definition, and rustdoc rather than clippy-driver is
    what compiles them, so no invocation of clippy will ever see one. Those ten are fixed by
    hand and the next such finding will have to be too. `ci.yml`'s header now carries the whole
    enumeration — every cargo target kind this workspace declares, with what compiles it, what
    lints it and what runs it, and doctests named as the one kind nothing lints. That
    enumeration, not the four warnings, is the point: this is the sixth defect in one week of a
    single shape — a gate whose stated scope is wider than what it actually builds (#181, #195,
    #200, #208, #217) — and a finite list written down once is what stops a seventh.

    The mechanism is worth restating because it constrains the fix. A target **filter**
    (`--examples`, `--benches`, `--all-targets`) that satisfies nothing warns `no targets
    matched` and exits **0**; a **named** target (`--example NAME`) errors and exits **101**.
    `--all-targets` is therefore safe on the clippy line only because `--all-features` shares
    that line, which makes every target's `required-features` satisfiable by construction.
    Narrowing the feature set there without narrowing the claim would reopen #217's hole on a
    brand-new line, so the header says to name the targets instead.

22. **The in-crate model of the wrapper hazard was unexercised on `cst_demote` — the one CST
    method whose loss is silent.** `NonForwardingWrapper` in `src/cst/sink/tests.rs` is the
    fixture that pins what a consumer-shaped emitter wrapper costs, and its `cst_demote`
    forward was dead code under the suite: pin 5 drives `cst_start`/`cst_finish` only, and
    every other demote exercise in the tree is direct-on-sink, through `ParseState`, or through
    the view/handle forwarding surfaces — none interposes a wrapper. Demonstrated rather than
    asserted, in the shape this repository requires: emptying that forward to a discard left
    the lib suite at **1747 passed, 0 failed**.

    That matters because of *which* method it is. `CstEmitter::cst_demote`'s *Required, not
    defaulted* section grades the five CST methods by failure direction — the four defaulted
    ones fail toward a loud, typed absence (`OrphanFinish`/`MismatchedFinish`/`UnclosedNodes`,
    or the inert-mark identity wall), while a swallowed demote fails toward a silent
    **presence**: the `StartNode` stays open and a sink cannot tell a swallowed demote from a
    legal panic residue. Requiredness, new in this release, closed the *inherited* discard —
    the empty impl no longer compiles — and left the population this gap covers untouched: a
    discard written deliberately, visible in a diff, and wrong.

    One cell closes it. `a_wrapper_forwards_the_node_brackets_failing_exit` opens the up-front
    bracket through the wrapper, keeps the handback, commits a token, abandons the bracket
    through the wrapper, and materializes through **strict** `finish` — asserting
    `demote_materialises_as_inert`'s outcome reached through a forwarder: the abandoned node
    materializes into nothing and the token survives loose beside it. Its falsifying edit was
    run in both directions before it landed, which is the only thing that makes a cell like
    this worth having: with the forward emptied it reds loudly and typed —
    `Err(FinishError::UnclosedNodes { open: 1 })`, and **1747 passed, 1 failed**, so the new
    cell is the sole detector — and with it restored the suite is **1748 passed, 0 failed**.
    Test-only; no shipped surface changed.

23. **The name-collision probe's `TRAITS` records are trusted, not verified, and the harness
    said so everywhere except where records are authored.** A trait row names the receiver its
    probe rides (`recvr`), and no run can check that the named value implements the trait: a
    subject that does *not* constructs no collision and reports a clean run, byte-identical to
    the clean run a correct subject produces whenever the consumer's item wins at an earlier
    pick. Measured for the shape it bites hardest — a `&mut self` trait method on a non-deref
    subject, where the consumer's blanket `impl<T>` claims every pick and tokora's item is
    never a candidate — swapping the blessed receiver for one that implements nothing produced
    the identical `7u8` from the consumer's item and the identical `CONSUMER-CALLS` witness on
    both sides, a byte-identical `ok*`. Such a row cannot be falsified by running it, so its
    `no_collision.txt` justification and the reviewer who agrees with it are the whole of its
    protection.

    This is a property of **method resolution**, not a gap in the templates, so no amount of
    generator work converts it into machine detection — which is why it lands as prose in three
    places rather than as a fix. `gen_probe.py`'s `TRAITS` table now carries the trust boundary
    above the rows themselves, with the measurement and the rule for picking a subject;
    `ci/name_collision/README.md`'s "What this harness does NOT test" gains the bound, stated
    as what it costs a reviewer — approving a record is a review act, not a mechanical one;
    and the generator's `no argument template` refusal now says the multi-argument support is
    **declined, not missing**, names the reopen condition (a traced-trait method whose shape
    the templates cannot express *and* whose pick analysis is not foreknown-vacuous), and
    routes the author who lands there to the ruling instead of into an unbounded enumeration.

    Comments and prose only, with zero verdict changes: driving both generators over 2,182
    invocations spanning every category, spelling, `TRAITS` owner and templated name produced
    **0** differences in exit status and **0** in generated probe source. Only the refusal
    text on stderr differs, which `run.sh` echoes into its log line and never matches.
    — *(#225)*

24. **The guide's event-stream chapter enumerated five of the six `Event` variants under a
    heading that counted them, and never mentioned `Demote`.** The section is headed *"The N
    events"*, so the count is a reader's only signal that the list is exhaustive — and the
    gap is undetectable from inside the text: someone learning the event stream came away
    with a model that has no demote in it, which is not an exotic corner but what the failing
    exit of every up-front `node()` bracket emits. `Demote` now gets the treatment the other
    five get — what it is, when the stream carries one, and what materialization does with it
    — and the chapter's other statements of the same fact are brought with it: the two-verb
    law now says *both* directions of the kind rewrite are encoded as appended events, the
    derived-depth sentence counts a `Demote` as `−1`, the materialization section documents
    the canonicalization pre-pass and `StaleDemote`, and *The combinator surface* describes
    the two bracket shapes (up-front `cst_start` / `cst_finish` | `cst_demote` for `node` as a
    plain parser, retro tombstone for the declining and `node_at` shapes) instead of claiming
    every one of them mints a tombstone. The `FinishNode` and `StartAt` entries also grew the
    fields they have carried since the leaked-finish detector and the wrap chain landed.

    The durable half is the heading. **An enumeration that carries a count in its heading is
    a trap that re-arms itself** — the next variant makes the count wrong again, silently.
    Dropping the number was the other option and was rejected: it removes the visible error
    and keeps the actual one, because a bulleted enumeration reads as exhaustive whether or
    not it counts itself, so a seventh variant with no seventh entry would still teach a
    model with a hole in it, just without the arithmetic that gave it away. The count stays
    and is now machine-checked. `GUIDE_EVENT_CENSUS` (`src/cst/event.rs`) parses the enum's
    own source with `syn`, reads the chapter's heading and entries, and reds when the count
    or the *set of names* drifts in either direction — a count alone cannot see a swap.
    Proven to discriminate rather than assumed to: a seventh variant added to `Event` reds it
    naming that variant, and each refusal arm is separately driven by a positive control over
    the real readers. Documentation and test only; no shipped surface changed.

25. **Six shipped passages said a descent trip makes "the session latch", which is the exact
    reading the crate rejects on the record — and the mechanism they attribute the behaviour to
    predicts the opposite of what the code does.** `examples/expr_recovery.rs` (four sites),
    `guide/ch05_pratt.md`, `tests/pratt_recovery.rs` and this changelog's own entry for the
    example all explained the terminal stop as a *latch on the session*, unqualified and as the
    reason recovery re-raises.

    Read absolutely, that is the semantics `tests/collection_resource_trip.rs` argues against in
    as many words: *"the session has tripped forever after… One deeply-nested expression early in
    a document would then suppress every diagnostic after it — which is precisely wrong for the
    editor and language-server consumers this crate is built for."* Every consulting site is
    instead **attempt-relative** — it snapshots the monotone counter before the attempt it is
    judging and re-raises only when the count moved during it.

    The behaviour the passages describe is real; the mechanism is not a latch but **terminality
    plus a per-attempt comparison**, and the two predict different things for a consumer that
    handles the trip: under a latch, a grammar that catches a trip and parses on would lose
    recovery for the rest of the parse, and it does not.
    `tests/pratt_limit_unit_sink.rs`'s `a_caught_trip_does_not_disable_a_later_recovery` has
    pinned the opposite since 0.9.0's #148 work — the tripping run and its untripped control are
    required to produce the identical result. So the passages were checked against that cell
    before being rewritten, not against each other.

    All six now state terminality and the per-attempt scoping, and the guide additionally
    distinguishes this from a `PartialSession`'s terminal latch,
    which *is* a latch, refuses later **attempts** over a growing buffer, and is the thing the
    word was borrowed from. Prose only; no behaviour changed. It travels with
    `Cst::resource_trips` above because that accessor is what finally makes the distinction
    observable to a consumer — session-absolute after the parse, attempt-relative during it —
    and a door whose docs contradicted six other passages would have been worse than either.

### Known limitation — Miri does not interpret the `rowan` lossless path at all, and cannot until rowan is fixed

**Zero coverage, not reduced coverage.** The Miri matrices run two feature sets, `logos` and
`logos,unstable-raw`. `rowan` is in neither and is not in `default`, so across all three targets
and both aliasing models, no Miri job in this repository has ever *compiled* the lossless CST
materialization path — the path this release ships as its lossless story. Measured on `543ce6d`:
`tokora/src` carries 66 mentions of `feature = "rowan"` across 8 files, of which **41 are
`#[cfg]` gates whose code exists only when the feature is on**. Those 41 are the uncovered set.
The remaining 25 are not code Miri is missing: 14 are `doc(cfg(...))` docs.rs labels, 10 are
doc-text alternations, and one is a `not(feature = "rowan")` arm the current runs do compile.

**Enabling `rowan` there is not the fix — it reddens the cells.** `rowan 0.16.1`, the version
`Cargo.lock` resolved when this was measured, executes undefined behaviour on its ordinary public
path, and the two models find it in two *different* places. Neither model is clean, so there is no
Tree-Borrows-only half-measure:

> **This release ships `rowan 0.17.0`, not 0.16.1** — see the `rowan` bump under *Changed
> (breaking)* above. The bump does **not** change anything below. Both sites were re-measured
> against 0.17.0 and both survived, moving only line numbers: `arc.rs:260` → `arc.rs:264` and
> `cursor.rs:219` → `cursor.rs:136`. The `arc.rs` `Deref` body is byte-identical across 0.15.19,
> 0.16.1, 0.16.2 and 0.17.0, and deleting `sll.rs` and rewriting `cursor.rs` from 1592 lines to
> 1003 did not clear the Tree Borrows half. The two frames, the two models and the conclusion are
> unchanged; the version and the line numbers were the only stale text, and they are corrected in
> `ci/miri_sb.sh`, `ci/miri_tb.sh`, `.github/workflows/miri.yml` and `tokora/Cargo.toml`.

- **Stacked Borrows** — `rowan-0.16.1/src/arc.rs:260`, `<HeaderSlice<H, [T; 0]> as Deref>::deref`
  forging a `&HeaderSlice<H, [T]>` over the whole slice out of a `&self` retagged for the header
  only. Reached here through `cst::sink::finish::replay` → `materialize` → `Cst::finish`, which
  is to say from building any tree at all.
- **Tree Borrows** — `rowan-0.16.1/src/cursor.rs:219`, `rowan::cursor::free` dropping a
  `Box<NodeData>` through a tag an ancestor's `Cell` still holds. Reached from dropping any
  red-tree `SyntaxNode`.

Both were reproduced on `543ce6d` on 2026-08-07 with
`cargo miri test --target aarch64-apple-darwin --test parser_node --features logos,rowan`, the
two runs differing only in `MIRIFLAGS`. Each was red on the **first** of that target's 24 tests.

**The defect is rowan's, not this crate's.** `src/cst` contains no `unsafe` at all. Upstream has
had it reported since 2021 — rust-analyzer/rowan#108, #163 and #192, all three still open — and
the only fix attempt, PR #211, is a draft whose own description says the immutable path still
fails. A version bump is not an answer either: the `arc.rs` construct is present unchanged in
`0.17.0`, the newest release.

**What this does and does not mean for a consumer.** The lossless path is not untested. It runs
in `cargo test --all-features` and `cargo test --release --all-features`, and in both sanitizer
cells, which are `--all-features` as well — so it is exercised, and exercised under ASan and
TSan. What it has never had is an *aliasing-model* check, which is the one class those gates
cannot see and Miri exists for. That bound is disclosed here rather than left to be discovered.

**What would flip it.** A published rowan clean at both sites under `-Zmiri-strict-provenance`
and under `-Zmiri-tree-borrows`. At that point `rowan` joins the feature sets in `ci/miri_sb.sh`
and `ci/miri_tb.sh`. The reason is written at each place a re-enabler arrives from — both of
those scripts, `.github/workflows/miri.yml`, and `tokora/Cargo.toml`'s `rowan` feature — so the
decision does not have to be rederived from this file.

## 0.8.0 (2026-08-04)

The whole of a 52-defect audit campaign lands in one release. Entries are grouped by **kind**, not by the round that produced them: a reader upgrading wants every breaking change in one place. Round provenance rides as an inline tag — *(R7, #117)* — and the pull-request bodies carry the full trail.

### Upgrading from 0.7.3 — the migration table

Every break a 0.7.3 consumer can hit, in one place. **Rows are ordered by how the break
announces itself, not by how many consumers hit it** — the ones your build will *not* point at
come first, because those are the ones you have to go looking for. Each row links to the
numbered entry below that carries the full reasoning.

#### These do not fail to compile. Read them first.

| Old behaviour | New behaviour | Why, in one line | Item |
|---|---|---|---|
| A `SimpleSpan` const mutator silently published an inverted or wrapped span — `with_end_const(2)` on `(5, 15)` gave `(5, 2)`; `bump_start_const` at `(MAX-1, MAX)` gave `(0, usize::MAX)` in release | panics: `end must be greater than or equal to start` / `span bump overflows usize` | The span was **already corrupt** and the program was carrying it. The panic is the bug becoming visible, not a new refusal. | [36](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| A properly closed `separated_by_*().delimited()` list ignored `at_least` / `at_most` / `bounded` and the separator policy | the policy runs: a recovering emitter records the diagnostic, a fail-fast one returns `Err` where it returned `Ok` | The end-state pass was dead code on that exit only. | [1](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| `TooMany` carried the running count, or the limit itself (`found 2 … exceeds … 2`) | `limit() + 1`, emitted once per construct | Payloads that contradicted themselves. | [2](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| `FullContainer` re-emitted per dropped element, counting past its own capacity | once per construct, on the whole-construct span | | [3](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| Bounded containers turned a satisfied `at_least` into `TooFew`, and swallowed a violated `at_most` | bounds judge the elements **parsed**, not the ones stored | Only bounded-capacity containers were affected. | [4](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| `SeparatorHandler::on_separator` received only leading and duplicate separators | receives every separator in source order | It received the exact complement of its documented contract. Opt out with `OBSERVES_SEPARATORS`. | [5](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| Delimited separated drivers returned a span measured from the first element on some exits | the whole construct's span, opener through closer, on every success exit | | [6](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| A dialect mapper returning an out-of-language kind reached `finish` as `Err(InvalidDialectKind)` | panics at the emit site, in every build | It is a dialect bug, not an input condition; no parse input can provoke it. | [14](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| A panic in caller code during `skip_until` lost the in-flight token and the skipped prefix | the stream is left consistent on the panic path too | Only observable to a host that catches a panic across a parse and keeps using the input. | [9](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| `Emitter::commit_token`'s observer ran before the committed position was published | runs **after** the position is published, before the replaced pair is dropped | An observer that panics no longer leaves the input naming a token the stream does not hold. | [10](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| A **wrapper** emitter over a recording `Sink` forwarded lexer errors by forwarding `emit_lexer_error` | must also forward the new `Emitter::commit_lexer_error`, exactly as it forwards `commit_token` | The input layer's own refusals now arrive through that method, and their spans are what license an untokenized byte. A wrapper that inherits the default turns them into caller reports, and the wrapped sink's `finish` then refuses a legitimately unlexable region as `UncoveredGap`. Diagnostics-only emitters are unaffected — the default forwards to `emit_lexer_error`. | [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| A parser or callback that reported a lexer error over an **unconsumed** region — `inp.emit_lexer_error(span)`, `view.emit_lexer_error(span)` — thereby licensed those bytes to be gap-tiled, and `finish` returned a tree | the report is delivered unchanged; it licenses nothing, so `finish` refuses the uncovered region as `UncoveredGap` | A recorded lexer-error span is a *licence*, and a caller-chosen span with nothing consumed for it is the deleted `cst_token` shape on the diagnostic channel. Materialize an unconsumed region with `Cst::finish_partial`, which tiles it. | [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| An `Incomplete` scan exit committed the frontier it reached | exits as it entered | A refill driver resumed at a half-consumed position. | [12](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| A terminal scanner stop (resource limit, poison boundary) reached callers as an ordinary end-of-input **decline** | surfaces as a terminal error **when your emitter accepts the diagnostic**, and recovery re-raises it instead of retrying. A *rejecting* emitter's `Err` is built from your lexer's error value and carries no mark, so recovery can still spend that trip — `MaybeTerminal`'s doc has that path and the arm it needs | Recovery was retrying against a scanner that had already given up. | [16](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| Collection drivers could stall on zero progress, or mask a terminal stop as a successful end | both exits are errors | | [17](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| `…, expected expected '}'` in `MissingToken` and `UnexpectedToken` renders | `…, expected '}'` | `Expected`'s own `Display` already supplies the word. **Re-bless frozen renders.** | [37](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| `UnexpectedEnd`'s derived `Debug` / `Eq` / `Hash` | include a `terminal: bool` field | Shipped four rounds ago and disclosed nowhere until now. **Re-bless frozen renders.** | [16](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| `Unclosed`'s derived `Debug`; `SeparatedError` / `MissingToken` derived `Debug`, `Eq`, `Hash` | include `kind` / the name channel | See *Debug and rendered output* below for the complete list. | [20](#0.8.0-changed-breaking), [28](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| A slice-choice id out of range panicked with `index out of bounds` | `choice id {id} out of bounds for {len} branches` | Message text only; reachability is unchanged. | [35](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| A wrong opening delimiter produced **two** diagnostics naming the same token — once as the wrong opener, once again as a close miss | exactly one | Only under a recording emitter, and only while the first report is still live in the log. Assertions that counted diagnostics on the recovering path change. | [40](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| A second same-power `PrattInfix::Neither` operator in one chain folded left in silence — `7 = 1 ; 2 ; 3` returned `Ok(((7=(1;2));3))` with the **whole input consumed**, so no end-of-input check had anything to catch | the parse fails with `NonAssociativeChain`, the operator left on the input unconsumed | Handing the operator up re-associates the chain across an enclosing frame that cannot know the constraint. Not terminal: recovery may still spend it. | [41](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| Recursive descent was unbounded — a deep enough expression exhausted the native stack and **aborted the process** | a shared per-input depth budget, **64** by default, failing the parse with the always-terminal `RecursionLimitReached` | An abort carries no diagnostic and cannot be caught; a refusal names the knob that raises it. `RecursionLimiter::unlimited()` restores 0.7.3's behaviour. | [42](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| `RecursionLimiter::new` / `Default`, and `Limiter::new` / `Limiter::with_token_tracker`, defaulted to depth **500** | **500** — unchanged, so there is nothing to do here. [43](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) dropped these four to 64 during the campaign and [50](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) returned them before release; only a build tracked between the two ever saw 64 | These constructors reach code with no pratt parser in it: the same type doubles as a **lexer-side** nesting tracker in a `State` / `Extras` position, where a level costs no native stack and 64 was a number chosen for a reason that does not apply. The depth that *does* change is the input layer's, in the row above. | [43](#0.8.0-changed-breaking), [50](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| Your own `emit_error` / `peek_kind` / `labelled` / `opt` / … resolved to *your* method | may resolve to tokora's, with **no diagnostic at the call site** | 130 new inherent items and 14 new defaulted trait methods enter the method space, and **67 of the inherent ones sit on types you already had** — that 67 is the exposure table, and it is the list to read. 38 of the 67 land on `InputRef` and `ParseState` under the emitter's own method names, which is where a 0.7.3 shortcut helper over `inp.emitter()` sat. Whether yours still wins is decided by rustc's **pick order**, not by inherent-ness. | [source-breaking additions that can change behaviour with *no diagnostic at the call site*](#0.8.0-source-breaking-additions-that-can-change-behaviour-with-no-diagnostic-at-the-call-site) |

| `Sink::new(emitter, map, ERR, GAP)` then `sink.finish(ROOT, source)` | `parse_lossless(source, state, emitter, CstProfile::new(map, ERR, GAP), cache, parser)` then `cst.finish(ROOT)` | Two independent names for one buffer is what let them disagree; [13](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) named it once at `Sink::new`, and [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) superseded that spelling before release by making `Sink::new` crate-private and minting the sink from the source itself — only a build tracked between the two ever called `Sink::new` directly. | [13](#0.8.0-changed-breaking), [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| A callback parameter typed `&mut Ctx::Emitter` | `EmitterView<'_, 'inp, L, Ctx::Emitter, Lang>` | Every `*_while` condition (`Decision::decide`), `ParseInput::peek_then`'s handler, `ParseChoice::peek_then_choice` / `peek_then_try_choice`'s handler, and the three token-level pratt folds. The view carries the emitter's own method names, so bodies do not change: **43 one-line signature changes, zero body changes, zero call-site changes** on the reference consumer. The same four getters — `peek_with_emitter`, `peek_with_emitter_terminal`, `sync_through_then_peek_with_emitter`, `sync_to_then_peek_with_emitter` — hand back a view in the tuple's second slot, so only a site that *named* that type breaks. | [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| `inp.emitter().emit_error(e)`, `state.emitter().cst_start(k)` | `inp.emit_error(e)`, `state.cst_start(k)` | `InputRef::emitter` is crate-private (`E0624`) and `ParseState::emitter` is deleted (`E0599`). Both handles gained the emitter's operations under the emitter's own names — 25 methods on `InputRef`, 13 on `ParseState` — so the fix is deleting `.emitter()` from the call. `InputRef::emitter_ref()` is the read-only replacement where you needed the value. **Those 38 names can also steal a same-named method of yours; see the exposure table.** | [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| `m.complete(inp.emitter(), KIND)` | `inp.cst_start_at(m.mark(), KIND); inp.cst_finish(KIND);` | `Marker::complete` takes `&mut E: CstEmitter` and a parse handle no longer hands one out, so `CompletedMarker` and `precede` are out of a grammar's reach too. Nothing is removed: the verb still works for code owning an emitter. The raw pair does not consume the marker, so the single-use typestate stops enforcing over that route. | [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| `emitter.cst_token(span, kind)` | delete it | Deleted, not deprecated. A token event is born from a settle; `Emitter::commit_token` is now the only producer. Nothing in the parse machinery ever called it. | [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |

| An error type without `MaybeTerminal` | `impl MaybeTerminal for MyError {}` is enough | Unless the type can itself carry a terminal stop, and **three** that this crate builds and marks can reach it: an `UnexpectedEnd` whose flag the scanner may raise; a `RecursionLimitReached` — new in this release, required of every pratt-driving error type — terminal for **every** value; and a `SessionRefusal`, terminal for every value too but *not* a `MaybeTerminal` implementor, so its arm is written `true` by hand. Answer for each one you store. An arm left at `false` is spent as a recoverable failure — except the refusal, which `PartialSession::parse` asserts on unconditionally, so that one panics a release build. Those three are what the crate knows it produces, **not** a proof that nothing else is terminal: a scanner trip a *rejecting* emitter refuses propagates as that emitter's `Err`, built from your lexer's error value and unmarked, so the arm holding your lexer error may need answering too — `MaybeTerminal`'s doc has that path and the rule for it. | [16](#0.8.0-changed-breaking), [46](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |
| `<[P; N] as ParseChoice>::Id::new(i)` (0-based) | `::new(i + 1)` (1-based) | `RangedUsize`'s bounds are inclusive, so the old id space admitted `N` and every `[P; 0]` id panicked. Tuple choices are unaffected. | [35](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) |

#### Additive — nothing to do, listed so you know it exists

`PolicyComposableEmitter` / `PolicyParseContext` (the count- and separator-policy bundle tier)
· `Emitter::bound_source` and `Source::REFERENT_IS_BYTES` (both defaulted) · `SourceIdentity`,
with `addr()` / `extent()` / `covers()` · `conformance::cache`
and `conformance::emitter` · `Dialect` · `CstText` · `PartialSession` and the streaming
lifecycle · `SeparatedError: Display` · `InputRef::is_exhausted()` · `Cache::RETAINS_FRONT` ·
`BStr` in the `Equivalent` family · `CstProfile` / `KindValidator` un-gated from `rowan` ·
`Silent`'s pratt impl loses four bounds it never used.

That list is additive **in the type system**. The names added below are not: adding a name
is a source break, and the two *Source-breaking additions* sections below say which
diagnostic you will get.

#### If you froze `Debug` or `Display` output

Every movement is listed in one place under **Debug and rendered output** below. A
private-field `Debug` delta broke a real consumer's frozen renders and cost a bisect during
this campaign, which is why that list exists at all.

#### Cross-references from earlier design documents

This release's `## 0.8.0` section was consolidated from twenty `###` headings carrying
five independently-numbered lists, so numeric cross-references written before the cut
("breaking change 3") do not resolve. The pull-request body carries the full old→new map.

### The new names, and why adding a name is still a break

Measured end to end, 0.7.3 against this release, this release adds **53 glob-reachable
root/module names**, **two new public modules** (`tokora::cst::kinds` and `tokora::dialect`,
each its own glob namespace), **23 trait-declared items** — 15 receiver methods, 2 associated
functions and 6 associated consts/types — and **130 inherent items — 119 receiver methods and
11 associated functions**, which resolve by different rules and are listed separately below for
that reason. An "inherent item" is counted once per `(name, owner type)` pair, because that pair
is what a collision is about: the same name on two owners is two questions a consumer answers
separately. The items themselves are under [Added](#0.8.0-added) with the rest of the release.

**Only part of that can collide with something you wrote, and the split is the useful number.**
**67 of the 130 inherent items — 64 methods and 3 associated functions — land on a type that
already existed in 0.7.3**; the other 63 land on types this release itself introduces, where no
extension method of yours can exist because you could not name the type. The exposure table
below is exactly those 67. On the trait side the same split is 13 of the 15 new methods, all of
them **defaulted**, on traits you already had (`ParseInput`, `TryParseInput`, `Emitter`,
`SeparatorHandler`); the other two are on new traits, which have to be imported before they can
compete.

**One item accounts for 72 of the 130, and it is a different shape from the rest of this
section.** [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) replaces `&mut Ctx::Emitter` with forwarded operations,
so the emitter's own method names land, in bulk, on the handles that used to hand the emitter
out: **25 on `InputRef`, 13 on `ParseState`, 27 on the new `EmitterView`, 7 on the new `Cst`.**
Only the first two are in the exposure table, for the reason above. The 38 that *can* collide
are all thin forwards of `Emitter` / `CstEmitter` methods under the emitter's own names, which
makes them the section's own worst case rather than an unusual one: `inp.emit_error(..)` is
exactly the shortcut a 0.7.3 consumer would have written over `inp.emitter().emit_error(..)`, on
exactly that receiver, with exactly a compatible signature. Read *the dangerous case is the one
that reads as safest*, below, as describing the expected outcome here and not a corner.

**Where those figures come from, and the correction they carry.** All of them are
`ci/name_collision/surface_diff.py` over rustdoc-JSON dumps of `468f7aa` (the 0.7.3 release
commit) and this branch's tip, at the `std,logos,trace,rowan` feature point — one run, one base,
one tool. **Earlier drafts of this section said 16 glob-reachable names, one new module, 6 trait
methods and 16 inherent items.** Each of those was true of the diff it was taken from — a
mid-campaign base, not 0.7.3 — and was then carried forward unchanged while the release kept
growing, which is the "second inventory that falls behind the first" this section warns about,
committed by this section. Re-running against 0.7.3 for [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) is what
surfaced it. **The enumerated lists further down are subsets and are labelled as such**; the
exposure table is not — it is the full 67, and the thirteen rows the re-audit added to it
(`InputRef::{is_exhausted, next_or_stop, try_expect_map_or_stop, peek_with_emitter_terminal}`,
`SeparatedError::{name, with_name, display_fmt}`, `UnexpectedEnd::{is_terminal, into_terminal}`,
`MissingToken::{name, with_name}`, `Unclosed::kind`, `Transaction::rollback_abandoning_points`)
are all new `(name, owner)` pairs on 0.7.3 types. Most were already documented elsewhere here as
*features* and simply never listed as names that can take a call site; one,
**`Transaction::rollback_abandoning_points` — a public method that rolls a transaction back while
abandoning the session points opened inside it — appears nowhere else in this changelog at all.**
*Found by the mechanical API diff; disclosed nowhere before.*

**A removal is part of this accounting too**, because it hands a name *back*: a consumer's
own `fn emitter(..)` on `InputRef` lost to tokora's inherent one in 0.7.3 and wins again here.
Measured against 0.7.3 on the same diff, [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) takes five inherent
items and one trait method off the surface — `Sink::new` (an associated function) and
`InputRef::emitter` become crate-private, `ParseState::emitter` is deleted, `Sink::finish` and
`Sink::finish_partial` move to `Cst` (a removal from `Sink` and an addition on `Cst`, counted
as both), and the trait method `CstEmitter::cst_token` is deleted. A sixth,
`Sink::with_trivia_policy`, leaves `Sink` for `Cst` on the same diff but was never in 0.7.3, so
it is an intra-release movement rather than a break a 0.7.3 consumer can hit. The release's
other removals are listed with the items that make them.

### The rule for new names, stated as weakly as it can honestly be stated

> **Any new public name can silently re-resolve a same-named item in your code. Whether
> you are told depends on spelling details that belong to the compiler, not to this
> crate.**

Four successively more precise versions of this rule were written during development and
each was falsified — never by a wrong mechanism, always by a **spelling nobody wrote down**.
The last one shipped a trait on the strength of "this name cannot collide silently, because
its type parameter never infers"; a turbofish supplies it, and discarding the return made
the collision silent with no error and no warning. That trait is not in this release.

So the rule above is the only form of it worth relying on, and the practical advice is
**detection, not prediction**:

> **If you have a method, associated function, free function, type or macro named any of
> the names in the two sections below, check that call site after upgrading.** The names
> are the complete generated list.

Everything after this point is *what was measured*, on the toolchains named. It is useful
for debugging an actual collision. It is not a guarantee, and a spelling not listed here is
not thereby safe.

### Source-breaking additions that can change behaviour with *no diagnostic at the call site*

#### Are you exposed? This question terminates.

**You are exposed if you have written a method or associated function with one of the names
below, on one of these receiver types:**

| you wrote it on | which names |
|---|---|
| `InputRef` | `try_expect_take`, `try_expect_take_or_stop`, `try_expect_map_or_stop`, `peek_head_map`, `head_satisfies`, `peek_kind`, `attempt_parse`, `spanning`, `descending`, `descend`, `recursion`, `is_exhausted`, `next_or_stop`, `peek_with_emitter_terminal` — and, from [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking)'s forwarding surface, `emit_error`, `emit_warning`, `emit_lexer_error`, `emit_unexpected_token`, `emit_skipped_region`, `emit_too_few`, `emit_too_many`, `emit_full_container`, `emit_missing_element`, `emit_missing_separator`, `emit_missing_leading_separator`, `emit_missing_trailing_separator`, `emit_unexpected_leading_separator`, `emit_unexpected_trailing_separator`, `emit_unclosed`, `emit_unexpected_end_of_lhs`, `emit_unexpected_end_of_rhs`, `enter_label`, `exit_label`, `cst_start`, `cst_finish`, `cst_mark`, `cst_start_at`, `emitter_bound_source`, `emitter_ref` |
| `ParseState` — the callback view, which had no row here before [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) gave it one | `emit_error`, `emit_warning`, `emit_lexer_error`, `emit_unexpected_token`, `emit_skipped_region`, `enter_label`, `exit_label`, `cst_start`, `cst_finish`, `cst_mark`, `cst_start_at`, `emitter_bound_source`, `emitter_ref` |
| `ParseAttempt` | `into_option` |
| `Ident` | `parse_except`, `try_parse_except` |
| `InputContext`, `ParserContext` | `with_recursion_limiter` |
| `RecursionLimiter` | `unlimited` (an associated function — see the resolution rule below) |
| `SeparatedError` | `name`, `with_name`, `display_fmt` |
| `MissingToken` | `name`, `with_name` |
| `UnexpectedEnd` | `is_terminal`, `into_terminal` |
| `Unclosed` | `kind` |
| `Transaction` | `rollback_abandoning_points` |
| any parser-shaped type — one implementing `ParseInput` or `TryParseInput` | `labelled`, `traced`, `list_until`, `separated1_by`, `peek_then_head`, `opt` |

That is a finite question you can answer about your own code, and it is the one to answer.
**Whether the compiler then tells you depends on how close your signature is to ours — so do
not rely on it telling you, and do not rely on using the return value.** The remedy is UFCS:
`MyTrait::peek_kind(inp)` pins your method by name and is immune to all of this.

**The two forwarding rows are not the same disclosure as the four above them, and saying so is
the point.** The other rows name helpers tokora happened to grow; those two name 38 methods
that exist *because* [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) took `inp.emitter()` away, under the emitter's
own method names, on the two receivers a 0.7.3 grammar already held. A consumer who wrote
`fn emit_error(&mut self, ..)` on `InputRef` to shorten `inp.emitter().emit_error(..)` was
writing the most natural helper available in 0.7.3, and it now competes with a tokora method of
the same name, the same receiver and a compatible signature. If you have an extension trait over
`InputRef` or `ParseState` at all, read its method list against those two rows rather than
scanning for a name you remember choosing.

**Why there is no shortlist of "the silent ones".** An earlier draft of this entry named
four, measured. It was still wrong: the measurement covered one shape of consumer. Whether a
collision goes silent depends on how close the consumer's signature is to tokora's — a
property of code that does not exist yet — so a list of silent names is not a wrong answer,
it is not a well-formed one. The table above is the question we *can* answer for you.

#### The dangerous case is the one that reads as safest

**If you wrote the helper first**, with the same name and a compatible signature — because
you needed `peek_kind` or `head_satisfies` while tokora lacked them — then tokora's method
takes the call with **no error and no warning, even when you use the return value**.
Measured, byte-identical consumer source, base against this release:

```
base  CONSUMER-CALLS: 1     head  CONSUMER-CALLS: 0     zero diagnostics on both sides
```

reproduced for `peek_kind`, `head_satisfies` and `peek_head_map` with the result bound by `?`
at the caller. **A discarded return is not the precondition; a compatible signature is
enough.**

And the inversion that matters: **the closer your helper is to ours, the quieter the
substitution — and the more likely it also changes behaviour.** `peek_kind` and
`head_satisfies` deliberately have *different halt semantics* from the `peek_one`-based
helper a consumer would have written; that difference is why they exist (see the
terminal-stop entries below). So a near-identical replacement is the most dangerous case
here, not the safest.

Nothing in this release detects this for you. `ci/name_collision/` probes a consumer whose
signature *differs* from tokora's — the loud case — and reports argument-taking names as
`loud` on the strength of its own probe's arity. That limit is stated in
`ci/name_collision/README.md`, and its pass message spells the same limits out inline — that the
inherent-method and associated-function probes take no arguments, so a `loud` verdict on an
argument-taking name in those two categories comes from the probe's own arity, while the
trait-method probes pass real arguments and their rows are genuine — so a reader of a CI log
is not told "PASS" without being told what it excludes.
Three reproductions of the case it cannot generate are checked in beside it.

#### The one sub-case that is fully characterised

A consumer whose signature is *incompatible* with tokora's, calling with the return
**discarded**. There the outcome does depend on the return type. This is a sub-case, not the
boundary — it is here because it is the part the tooling covers:

| name | discarded value | reported as |
|---|---|---|
| `peek_kind` | `Result<…>` | ``warning: unused `Result` that must be used`` |
| `list_until` | `impl FnMut(…)` | ``warning: unused implementer of `FnMut` that must be used`` |
| `opt` | `impl FnMut(…)` | ``warning: unused implementer of `FnMut` that must be used`` |
| `into_option` | `Option<…>` | **nothing** — `Option` is not `#[must_use]` as a type |
| `labelled` · `traced` · `peek_then_head` | a plain adapter struct | **nothing** |

The discriminator there is whether the `unused_must_use` lint fires: a callable return is
covered by the lint's own rule for unused function-like values, an `Option` is not covered
at all, and a plain struct is not either. It is not "returns `Result`" and not
"is `#[must_use]`".

**There is deliberately no "full silent surface" list here.** An earlier draft gave one, of
fourteen names — and it omitted `parse_except` and `try_parse_except`, which are exactly the
two the paragraph above refuses to call safe. Any such list is the well-formedness problem
again. **The names to check are the exposure table at the top of this section** — it lists every
method and associated-function name this release adds **on a type that already existed in
0.7.3**, against the receiver each one lands on. Names on types this release itself introduces
are outside that question by construction, not by omission: you cannot have written an
extension method on a type you could not name. No count is restated here: a restated count is a
second inventory that can fall behind the first, and this one twice did. Which of those names go
silent for *your* code depends on your signatures, which is a thing only your code can answer.

What was measured, on rustc 1.87, 1.95 stable and 1.97-nightly:

- **Pick order, not inherent-ness, decides.** For `recv.m(..)` rustc walks the receiver's
  autoderef chain and, at each step, tries the receiver by value, then `&`, then `&mut`.
  Each is a *pick*. Within one pick an inherent candidate beats a trait candidate — but a
  tokora method taken **by value** sits at an earlier pick than your `&self` method on the
  same type and wins regardless, even against your *inherent* method. A method reached
  through a type parameter's bound (`fn f<T: MyTrait>(t: &T)`) buckets inherent at that
  pick, so generic code that names its combinator in a `where` clause is protected and
  concrete code is not.
- **How loud it is depends on your code's shape, not on the steal.** A fully inferable call
  site flips **silently** — compiles, no warning, runs the other method. A generic one
  leaves type variables unresolved and gets **`E0282`**. A concrete incompatible one gets
  **`E0308`**, or **`E0061`** on an arity mismatch, pointing into tokora's source. None of
  the three names the real cause.
- **A discarded return removes the last defence.** If a call ignores the result there is no
  type for the compiler to disagree about, and the steal is silent even where the same call
  with its return *used* is loud. Which names that reaches is the `unused_must_use` table
  earlier in this section: four report nothing, three report a warning, and the rest fail to compile — but
  only for a consumer whose signature is *incompatible* with ours, which is the sub-case
  that table describes.
- **The one breadcrumb.** If your method came from an extension trait you imported with a
  `use`, the steal strands that import and rustc emits **`warning: unused import`** naming
  the trait. An unused-import warning on a combinator trait after upgrading means one of
  its methods was re-resolved. If the trait is declared in the same file, you get nothing
  at all. The remedy either way is UFCS: `MyTrait::labelled(parser, "name")`.

**One entry here was measured after the rest of this section was written.** It concerns a
name this release adds, which the exposure table above already lists — what that table did
not carry is that this one is measured **silent**, and that is news a 0.7.3 consumer needs.

#### `RecursionLimiter::unlimited` — measured SILENT, and it is your call site to check

**You are exposed if you wrote an `unlimited()` associated function on `RecursionLimiter`.** That
type is public in **0.7.3**, so this is not hypothetical: any consumer holding one already had
somewhere to hang the name, and 0.8.0's
[`RecursionLimiter::unlimited`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/state/recursion_tracker/struct.RecursionLimiter.html#method.unlimited)
now competes for it by path.

Reproduced two-sided by `ci/name_collision/`, base `60f27a3` against this branch:

```text
SILENT  unlimited/discarded    base=witness=1  head=witness=0
```

Both sides compile, **neither emits any diagnostic**, and the two run different functions: yours
on 0.7.3, tokora's on 0.8.0 and later. `unlimited/used` is `loud` on the same probe, so a
discarded return is the whole of the difference — `RecursionLimiter` carries no `#[must_use]`, and
`unused_must_use` does not fire on a plain struct. **The remedy is UFCS**: `MyTrait::unlimited(..)`
or `<RecursionLimiter as MyExt>::unlimited()` pins your function by name and is immune to this.

`#[must_use]` was considered and rejected as the fix: it would not reach the case that matters —
a consumer who *assigns* the result, which the harness cannot generate and which stays silent
regardless — while firing on legitimate discards. Disclosure is the honest instrument here.

Two things about *why this arrives late*, both of which are the point rather than an excuse:

- 0.8.0's exposure table already lists `unlimited` under "you wrote it on `RecursionLimiter`", so
  the *name* was disclosed. What was not disclosed is that this one is **measured silent**, in a
  category the harness's README says a silent row "would be news" in — the first
  `inherent_assoc_fn` row ever to score one. The probe could not construct it at the time: #147
  introduced the owner and `gen_probe.py` had no template for it, so every row on that owner came
  back `FATAL` — an *incomplete* verdict, which is not a clean one. #148's Stage A added the
  templates and the `new-owner` verdict, and the finding fell out immediately.
- It is disclosed on **this** branch and could not wait. The probe's inventory is a two-sided
  delta: once this merges, `unlimited` exists on both sides, the row leaves every future plan, and
  the harness can never re-litigate it. A green run after that would mean "not probed", not "not
  colliding".

Recorded in `ci/name_collision/disclosed.txt`, whose fourth-and-fifth-row split now states plainly
that the earlier four ride a bounded receiver and **this one does not**: `RecursionLimiter` is a
concrete public struct with no bound to reject anybody.

#### `ParseState`'s zero-argument forwarders — four measured SILENT

**You are exposed if you wrote a method of your own on `ParseState`**, the view a `map_with` /
`and_then_with` / `validate_with` / `fold` callback is handed. That type is public in **0.7.3**
and until [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) it declared **no inherent item at all** — a callback
reached the emitter through `state.emitter()`, so `fn exit_label(&mut self)` on `ParseState`
was the natural way to shorten that, and it now competes with a tokora method of the same name
on the same receiver.

Reproduced two-sided by `ci/name_collision/`, base `7b289bc` against this branch, rustc 1.97.1:

```text
SILENT  cst_mark/discarded              base=witness=1  head=witness=0
SILENT  emitter_bound_source/discarded  base=witness=1  head=witness=0
SILENT  emitter_ref/discarded           base=witness=1  head=witness=0
SILENT  exit_label/discarded            base=witness=1  head=witness=0
```

Both sides compile, **neither emits any diagnostic**, and the two run different programs: yours
before, tokora's after. Each `used` row is `loud` on the same probe (`E0308`), so a **discarded
return** is the whole of the difference — and none of the four returns something
`unused_must_use` fires on: `()`, a plain `EventMark`, an `Option`, a shared reference. Same
discriminator as the `unused_must_use` table above — the lint, not a `#[must_use]` attribute.

**Read this as "the four the harness could reach", never as "the other nine are safe".** These
four are the whole of `ParseState`'s zero-argument set; the probe's consumer takes no arguments,
so for the nine forwarders that take one or two the head side fails on the probe's **own arity**
(`E0061`) and the row is filed `loud` — a verdict about the probe, not about the name. The
question that terminates is still the exposure table at the top of this section, and the remedy
is still UFCS: `MyTrait::exit_label(state)` pins your method by name.

Recorded in `ci/name_collision/disclosed.txt`. They are disclosed on **this** branch for the
reason `RecursionLimiter::unlimited` was: the probe's inventory is a two-sided delta, so once
this merges the names exist on both sides, the rows leave every future plan, and the harness can
never re-litigate them.

### Source-breaking additions that fail *loudly*

- **`E0034`, "multiple applicable items in scope"**, when one of the **14** new defaulted method
  names on a trait you already had meets a same-named method from another trait **at the same
  pick**, with that trait in scope: `labelled`, `traced`, `list_until`, `separated1_by`,
  `peek_then_head`, `try_delimited`, `try_delimited_by_parens`, `try_delimited_by_braces`,
  `try_delimited_by_brackets` and `try_delimited_by_angles` on `ParseInput`; `opt` on
  `TryParseInput`; `bound_source` and `commit_lexer_error` on `Emitter`; `observe_separator` on
  `SeparatorHandler`.
  (`CstText::cst_text` and `MaybeTerminal::is_terminal` are the release's other two new trait
  methods and are not in that thirteen: their traits are new, so they compete only once you
  import them.) Blanket-ness is irrelevant — a trait with exactly one impl for one concrete
  input type collides identically. rustc prints its own disambiguation suggestions; the fix
  is UFCS.

  **`commit_lexer_error` is the one name in that list the probe cannot construct, and saying
  so is the point.** It takes `&mut self`, and the harness's three trait-method spellings
  declare `self` or `&self` — both **earlier** picks on a non-deref receiver, so the
  consumer's item wins on both sides and tokora's is never a candidate. The `E0034` above
  therefore rests on the same-pick rule rather than on a measurement, and it applies to the
  consumer who declares `&mut self`, which is the shape that competes. Recorded, with the
  receiver walk, in `ci/name_collision/no_collision.txt` rather than left to look like a
  clean run.

- **Associated functions resolve by a different rule, and it is not the receiver walk.**
  `Ident::parse_except` and `Ident::try_parse_except` are inherent **associated functions**.
  A path call `Type::name(..)` has no receiver, so no autoderef and no autoref happen;
  inherent associated items simply beat trait ones. A consumer trait that supplied either
  name loses it.

  **These two are not more strongly protected than the methods above, and an earlier draft
  of this entry said they were.** It claimed every collision shape here is loud, on the
  strength of the probe — but that probe declares a zero-argument consumer against a
  two-argument function, so its `loud` verdict comes from its own arity and measures
  nothing about the name. Treat these exactly like the receiver methods: if you wrote
  `parse_except` on `Ident`, check the call site and do not rely on a diagnostic.

  What *is* established, for the narrow sub-case of an incompatible signature with the
  return **discarded**: both functions return `Result`, which is `#[must_use]`, so a
  discarded result warns.

  **Unsupported is not the same as disproven, and the difference is the whole finding.**
  Two attempts to build a silently-stealing consumer for `parse_except` produced a compile
  error instead; a different reviewer, with a different signature, produced a silent steal.
  Neither outcome settles it, because whether a collision is reported depends on how close
  the consumer's signature is to ours — and that is a property of code that does not exist
  yet. So this entry does not claim these two names are safe, and does not claim they are
  unsafe. It claims the earlier assertion of safety had nothing behind it.

- **Ambiguity between two glob imports**, for the **53** new glob-reachable names. Twenty of
  them were enumerated by path during the campaign and probed, and they are the list below;
  the other 33 are the new public types, traits, type aliases and functions this release adds,
  every one of them an *item* name, so the item row of the table below governs them too — they
  are under [Added](#0.8.0-added) rather than repeated here. The twenty: `Pinned`,
  `pinned`, `WhileHead`, `WhileKind`, `while_head`, `while_kind`, `select`, `try_select`,
  `attempt`, `syntax_kinds` via `tokora`; `EmitterView` via `tokora` **and**
  `tokora::emitter`; `dispatch_take`, `try_dispatch_take` via
  `tokora::parser`; `kinds`, `Cst`, `parse_lossless` and `parse_lossless_partial` via
  `tokora::cst`; `RecursionLimitReached` and
  `NonAssociativeChain` via `tokora::error`; and `Descent` via `tokora::input`. The two new
  modules, `tokora::cst::kinds` and `tokora::dialect`, each open a glob namespace of their own.
  `select!` against `tokio::select!` or
  `futures::select!` is the real-world instance — and the four macro names are the whole of the
  macro row below, so the item row governs every other new name in this release, enumerated here
  or not. The four
  [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) adds are all *item* names; they were classified by kind from the
  branch diff rather than
  re-measured on the three toolchains, which is the same treatment items
  [41–46](#0.8.0-changed-breaking)'s three had. **The diagnostic and its remedy differ by what
  kind of name collides, and — for macros only — by toolchain:**

  | Colliding name | 1.87 | 1.95 stable | 1.97 nightly |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | item (`Pinned`, `while_head`, …) | hard `error[E0659]` | hard `error[E0659]` | hard `error[E0659]` |
  | macro (`select`, `try_select`, `attempt`, `syntax_kinds`) | hard `error[E0659]` | `ambiguous_glob_imports` **warning** | `ambiguous_glob_imports` **error** |

  `#[allow(ambiguous_glob_imports)]` **does not suppress the item rows on any toolchain**,
  and does not suppress the macro row on 1.87 either. For an item name there is exactly one
  fix: an explicit `use` naming the one you meant.

**Why the names were not changed instead.** 0.8.0 is a breaking release and these are the
right names. One name *was* removed rather than disclosed — see `pinned` under
[Added](#0.8.0-added) — because it was the only addition that planted a candidate on every
`Sized` type in your program, and the argument for accepting that was the loudness
guarantee the turbofish spelling refuted. A source census of the known consumer, run
during development, found zero declarations of any of these names and zero
`use tokora[::…]::*` glob imports. **That census is not re-runnable from this repository —
its script is not shipped here — so treat it as a development note rather than a check you
can repeat.** It also saw one consumer at one commit. The disclosure above is the control;
the census was never more than corroboration.

### Changed (breaking)

Numbered once across the whole release. The groups are ordered by **how a break announces itself**: the ones that do not fail to compile come first, because nothing in your build will point at them.

*Repetition drivers' end-state accounting.* Six deliberate behaviour changes, all in the
repetition drivers' end-state accounting. No API is removed or renamed.

1. **A properly closed separated + delimited list now reports its count bounds and separator
   policy.** `…separated_by_*().delimited::<D>()` left its element loop through the mid-scan
   closer without running the end-state pass, so on every well-formed, properly closed list the
   whole of `at_least` / `at_most` / `bounded` and the leading/trailing separator policy was
   dead code — the sibling `separated_*_while` driver ran it on the identical path. Under a
   recovering emitter such a list now records the diagnostic it always should have; under a
   fail-fast emitter a bounds- or policy-violating closed list is now an `Err` where it used to
   be a silent `Ok`.

   — *(R7, #117)*

2. **`TooMany` is emitted once per construct, with a count that exceeds the limit it names.**
   `nums()` is now `limit() + 1` at every emission site. It used to be either the running count
   (so the same four-element history yielded a different payload from each builder) or, from
   the mid-loop hook, the limit itself — a "found 2 … exceeds … 2" that contradicted itself.
   The duplicate emission (mid-loop hook plus a delegating end check) is gone.

   — *(R7, #117)*

3. **`FullContainer` is emitted once per construct**, on the whole-construct span in every
   driver, with a `nums()` that includes the refused element. A container that refuses one push
   refuses every later one, so the old per-dropped-element re-emission produced a count that
   climbed past the capacity it named.

   — *(R7, #117)*

4. **Count bounds now judge the elements the driver parsed, not the ones the container
   stored.** In the separated drivers a bounded container used to turn a satisfied `at_least`
   into a spurious `TooFew`, and — worse — to swallow a violated `at_most` entirely by clamping
   the count the check reads. Only bounded-capacity containers are affected; with `Vec`,
   `VecDeque`, `SmallVec` and `TinyVec` the stored and parsed counts are always equal.

   — *(R7, #117)*

5. **`SeparatorHandler::on_separator` now receives every separator in source order.** It used
   to receive the exact complement of its documented contract — only the leading separator and
   the duplicates in a run, never the happy-path or trailing ones. A container that ignores
   separators can opt out with the new defaulted `SeparatorHandler::OBSERVES_SEPARATORS`
   associated const, which suppresses both the call and the clone that feeds it; every
   container in this crate does. Adding the const makes `SeparatorHandler` no longer
   object-safe — `dyn SeparatorHandler` no longer compiles. Nothing in this crate used it.

   — *(R7, #117)*

6. **The delimited separated drivers return the whole construct's span**, opener through
   closer, on every success exit. Some exits previously returned a span measured from the first
   element instead, so the returned span excluded the opener and depended on which exit the
   parse took.

   — *(R7, #117)*

*The input layer's unwind edges.* Nothing that can unwind runs between taking a token out of the
stream and recording where it went. Every scan, guard and emitter edge that previously had caller
code in that gap now settles on the panic path as well as the return path, and the rollback
protocol has one owner instead of two.

7. **`Cache::rewind` is removed.** Rollback was implementable in two places — the cache
   could rewind itself, and the input drives the same rollback through its lineage — so a
   cache that took the first route and an input that took the second disagreed about what
   the stream held. There is now one owner. Implementors of `Cache` delete the method; the
   four in-tree implementations did, and no caller loses a capability, because every public
   rollback path already went through the input.

   — *(R9)*

8. **`Cache`'s non-panicking restore-path law now names `push_front`.** The clause previously
   listed the reading and removing operations the crate calls while restoring — `pop_front`,
   `pop_back`, `clear`, `front`, `front_span`, `len` — and omitted the one *writing* operation,
   which is exactly the one the new unwind edge in item 9 depends on. An implementation whose
   `push_front` can panic was vacuously conforming before and is not now.

   The rider is stated rather than implied: a `push_front` that panics is the single case the
   crate **cannot** make whole, because it has already taken the token by value and nothing can
   un-take it. Every other restore-path operation is recoverable.

   — *(R9)*

9. **A panic inside caller code no longer corrupts the stream.** `skip_until` pops a token
   out of durable state — the parked slot, or the cache front — and then runs caller code
   over it: the predicate, the expected-tokens closure, `L::State: Clone`, the lexer
   itself. Any of those can panic, and a panic through one used to be an exit that no
   put-back and no settle ever saw. The in-flight token was dropped with an unowned local,
   the skipped prefix stayed behind a frontier that was never committed, and a rewinding
   mode's entry mark was neither rewound nor released. **With a warm cache that lost tokens
   outright.** A `Verbose` record could likewise tear if the payload's own allocation
   panicked mid-push.

   The unwind edge is split by **disposition**, and each half mirrors an exit the scan
   already owns. Committing modes (`SyncTo`, `SkipWhile`) behave as their fatal exit does —
   commit the diagnosed prefix, put the in-flight token back — so a host that catches and
   retries resumes *after* the diagnosed prefix with no duplicate reports. Rewinding modes
   (`SyncThrough`, `SyncBalanced`) restore the full pre-call state and rewind the mark **when
   the scan is abandoned mid-flight**.

   Disposition follows the **exit, not the mode**: once a stop has been decided, an
   interrupted stop keeps the diagnosed prefix for every mode. `SyncBalanced` is where that
   distinction is load-bearing — it rewinds at end of input and keeps on a stop — so the
   guard reads which exit it was interrupted in rather than which mode it is running. A uniform clear was tried and
   measured doing real harm on the committing path — it discarded pre-entry cache entries,
   the re-lex re-burned a shared limit budget, and a poison boundary latched at a position
   the original lineage never reached.

   This is a behaviour change only for a host that catches a panic across a parse and keeps
   using the input. Callers that let a panic propagate see no difference.

   — *(R9)*

10. **The committed position is written as one step, everywhere.** The position is a *pair* —
    the span, and the lexer state that produced it — and many sites wrote it in two steps with
    caller code in between. At end of input, `SyncTo::on_eof` advanced the span and then called
    `lexer.into_state()`; a panic there left the span advanced with the entry state still paired
    to it, so a host that caught and resumed lexed from the new offset under a state that had
    seen nothing. Reachable through `sync_to`, `skip_while` and `padded`, and only for
    **stateful** lexers — the population least likely to notice.

    **Advancing the span without supplying the state is no longer expressible.** The span-only
    setters are gone — once every caller had to pass the state, the compiler reported them as
    dead code — and the internal token settle carries the state to a single funnel that
    evaluates every fallible step first, writes both halves as infallible moves, and drops the
    replaced values afterwards. A `Drop` is caller code; dropping in place would run it between
    the halves, which is the tear itself. Where a restore has more to do than the position, the
    funnel hands the replaced pair back so the caller drops it only after the watermark, the
    poison latch and the emitter mark are restored too.

    **Both halves are installed before either replaced value is dropped**, at every site that
    writes one. That ordering is the property a future change has to preserve, and the reason
    is easy to miss: an assignment installs its new value and *then* drops the old one, so
    `span = …; state = …;` lets the replaced span's destructor run **between** the two writes.
    If it unwinds there, the second write never happens and one token's span is published
    beside the previous token's state — off by exactly one, silently, and only for spans or
    states that have a destructor at all.

    This is internal surgery: `Emitter::commit_token`'s signature is unchanged, so emitter
    implementations need no edit. The one implementor-visible consequence is an ordering change
    — the `commit_token` observer hook now runs **after** the position is published and
    **before** the replaced pair is dropped, so a panicking destructor cannot swallow the
    notification.
    Every caller reaches it having already taken the token off the front of the stream, so
    notifying first would leave the committed position naming a token the stream no longer
    holds, and a host that caught the observer's panic would resume past a token it never saw.
    An observer that panics now leaves the input consistent, with only the notification missing.

    — *(R9)*

11. **`Lexer` gains a clause: the settle path's operations must not panic.** This is a real new
    constraint on `Span` and `Offset` implementations, not a footnote, and it is the one window
    in the consume path that **cannot** be closed by reordering.

    The input layer settles a consumed token by computing the committed position **from that
    token's own span**. The span does not exist until the token has been popped, so those steps
    necessarily run after the token has left the stream and before the position has moved. The
    operations are `Source::len`; `Span::end_ref` and the `Ord` on `Offset` that decide whether
    a clamp is needed; `Span::clone` on the common path; and, only when the span is clamped to
    the source, `Span::start_ref` plus `Offset::clone` plus `Span::new`. **None of them may
    panic.**

    Two operations that were in this window during development are **not** in it and are
    deliberately absent from that list: the `Drop` of the span and state a commit replaces, and
    the `Drop` of the `Source::len` temporary. Both were moved out — the replaced pair is handed
    back to the caller and dies after the settle, and the length temporary now rides out with
    it. Nothing above is removable for the same reason, stated once: **every one of them is
    computed from the token's own span, which does not exist until the token has been taken.**

    The posture matches `Emitter::release`/`rewind` and the `Cache` restore-path operations, and
    for the same reason: the operation runs where nothing else can repair it.

    **The bounds are unchanged: `Lexer::Span` still requires `Clone`, not `Copy`.** A span that
    allocates, refcounts or carries a `Drop` is still welcome — an `Arc`-carrying file id clones
    by bumping a refcount, which cannot panic, and satisfies this clause fine. `Copy` would force
    the clause for free, and was rejected precisely because it would ban working code to close a
    window that a non-panicking `Clone` already closes. The in-tree types happen to satisfy it
    trivially (`SimpleSpan` is `Copy`; `usize` offsets neither allocate nor drop), which is why
    the default configuration pays nothing.

    Like the two clauses it matches, this is an obligation the crate **states and cannot check** —
    Rust has no "this impl does not panic" bound. A span whose `Clone` can allocate and abort
    under memory pressure will still lose a token, and nothing catches it at compile time.

    **What you get in return is a statable guarantee:** if your span's clone, construction,
    comparison and drop do not panic, a consumed token is never lost.

    Two alternatives were measured and rejected. Cloning the span before the pop costs an extra
    `front()` read on `next`, the hottest path in the crate; passing the span by value only
    relocates the clone — it helps `next`, which destructures, and hurts `consume_cached_one`,
    which keeps the `Spanned`.

    — *(R9)*

12. **An `Incomplete` scan exit leaves no trace.** A scan that ran out of input mid-decision
    used to commit the frontier it had reached, so a caller that topped up the source and
    retried resumed at a position the first attempt had already half-consumed. It now exits
    as it entered.

    — *(R9)*

*CST sink construction and materialization.* A CST sink is bound to its source when it is built,
not when it is finished, and the materialization walk no longer rescans.

13. **`Sink::new` takes the source and a `CstProfile`; `finish` and `finish_partial` no
    longer take a source.** The source is bound once, at construction, and the three loose
    `u16` parameters (`mapper`, `error_kind`, `gap_kind`) move into `CstProfile` alongside
    the new `KindValidator`.

    **What this buys, stated exactly.** There were two chances to hand the sink the wrong
    buffer: at construction and again at `finish`. The second is gone — you can no longer
    materialize against a source the sink was not built with. The first remains open, and it
    is one witness of the limitation below.

    ```rust
    // before
    let sink = Sink::new(emitter, map_kind, ERROR, GAP);
    let (green, emitter) = sink.finish(ROOT, source);

    // after
    let sink = Sink::new(source, emitter, CstProfile::new(map_kind, ERROR, GAP));
    let (green, emitter) = sink.finish(ROOT);
    ```

    — *(R8, #123)*

14. **An out-of-language kind now panics at the door, in every build.** A dialect mapper that
    returns a kind outside its own kind space — or the reserved tombstone `u16::MAX` — is
    refused by an `assert!` at the emit site (`cst_start`, `cst_start_at`, and the shared
    `record_token` body behind both token doors, plus `CstProfile::new` for the two
    synthesized kinds). Previously the same input reached `finish` and came back as
    `Err(FinishError::InvalidDialectKind)`.

    **This is a behaviour change for a caller that relied on the error.** It is a panic
    because the condition is a dialect bug, not an input condition: the mapper is the
    dialect's own code, no parse input can provoke it, and refusing at the cause reports it
    one materialization earlier than the error did.

    The honest limit, which is also stated at the site: the *per-event* validator inside
    `finish` is `cfg!(debug_assertions)`-gated, because keeping it in every build costs a
    measured **+4.4%** on ordinary materialization — an indirect call per event inside a tight
    builder loop. Every route reachable from outside this crate goes through a door that
    validates in every build, so for external callers the wall is absolute. The one route with
    no door is `push_raw_event_for_tests`, which is `pub(crate)`. So: a **release** build whose
    event log was assembled by raw in-crate injection can materialize an out-of-language kind.
    Debug-assertions test runs, and the CI profiles that run this cell, refuse it;
    release-profile test runs do not exercise that wall. `ReservedKind` is not gated — the
    tombstone band is a plain comparison and was a release wall before this round.

    **That +4.4% is measured on the shipped fused walk, and it withdraws a +8.3%.** The
    withdrawn figure was taken on the two-pass gather+walk shape item 51 superseded, where
    these three calls sat in the *gather* pass rather than in the builder loop. The
    remeasurement is the shipped tree against the same tree with `cfg!(debug_assertions) &&`
    deleted from exactly those three sites and nothing else: the inlined `materialize` carries
    one indirect branch in the shipped build — the once-per-materialization root check — and
    four in the ungated one, so the per-event call is really there and really indirect.
    `finish_clean` (8 192 tokens) reads **+4.4%**, the median of sixteen interleaved paired
    rounds, positive in all sixteen and spread +2.1% to +6.9%, against a null control of two
    byte-identical builds of one source read as that same per-round statistic: −1.15% to +1.13%
    about a median of −0.08%, so it is wider than the aggregate-median floor the **Performance**
    section quotes and is the one this comparison is scored against. The two populations do not
    overlap. `finish_error_dense` reads +2.0%, `finish_wrap_heavy` +3.3%. The same deletion on
    the *two-pass* shape reads **+1.1%** — a median inside the control's own span, populations
    overlapping, only eleven of sixteen rounds above their own round's control — so 8.3% is
    reproduced on neither shape, and in absolute terms the fold made these three checks dearer
    rather than cheaper: 0.07 ns per call in the gather pass against 0.37 ns in the builder
    loop. One code layout on one toolchain, so read it as low single digits rather than as a
    constant. The trade the gate buys is smaller than this entry claimed. It is still real, and
    clear of the noise floor, and the gate stays.

    — *(R8, #123; the per-event cost remeasured against the shipped fold)*

15. **`FinishError` gains `InvalidDiagnosticSpan`, `MismatchedFinish`, `NonUtf8Source` and
    `InvalidDialectKind`, and `CstEmitter::cst_finish` takes the kind it intends to close.**
    The sink now names the node it closed, so a mismatched finish reports which frame it
    failed against instead of producing a misparented tree — and the identity it compares
    against has to come from somewhere, so `cst_finish` gained a `kind: u16` parameter. It is
    a **defaulted** trait method, so an implementor that does not override it is unaffected;
    every *caller* and every overriding implementor passes the kind it passed to the matching
    `cst_start` / `cst_start_at`.

    **Migration:** `emitter.cst_finish()` becomes `emitter.cst_finish(KIND)`, with `KIND` the
    value the matching open used. Passing a different kind is what
    `FinishError::MismatchedFinish` reports.

    — *(R8, #123)*

*Terminal stops, collection drivers and session points.* A scanner that stops on a resource
limit or a poison boundary is not an end of input, and a driver that cannot make progress is
not a driver that succeeded. Four rounds of repair share one shape: a condition that used to
be reported as *absence* is now reported as *failure*, and the types say so.

16. **A terminal scanner stop is surfaced as an error, never as a decline.** A resource-limit
    trip or a latched poison boundary used to reach a caller as an ordinary end-of-input
    decline, so recovery treated it as "nothing here" and retried against a scanner that had
    already given up. `UnexpectedEnd` now carries a **terminal** flag, raised through
    `into_terminal()` and read back through `is_terminal()`, and the new public trait
    `error::MaybeTerminal` is the channel recovery keys off to re-raise the stop instead of
    recovering it.

    **This is a bound addition on the error type.** `From<UnexpectedEot<L::Offset, Lang>>` is
    now required on the committed peek and `Expect` surfaces, and a downstream error type must
    implement `MaybeTerminal` — an empty `impl MaybeTerminal for MyError {}` is enough unless
    the type can itself carry a terminal stop, in which case it delegates. This release ships a
    **second** terminal carrier alongside the flag: `RecursionLimitReached` (item 46), which is
    terminal for every value, so a type that stores both delegates to both. A **third** terminal
    source ships in this same release and is easy to miss precisely because it is not a
    `MaybeTerminal` implementor at all: `SessionRefusal`. `PartialSession::parse` converts it
    through the consumer's `From` and then asserts the result is terminal, unconditionally — so a
    `Refused(SessionRefusal)` arm left at `false` panics a release build rather than being spent
    (see *A session's budget guard now holds in release builds*, under Fixed). Those three are the
    values this crate **builds and marks**, which is not the same as a closed set of terminal
    conditions: when a *rejecting* emitter refuses a scanner trip's diagnostic, the emitter's `Err`
    is what propagates, built from your lexer's error value through
    `From<<L::Token as Token>::Error>` with no marker on it — the same trip, unmarked, reaching you
    through a different carrier. The trait's own doc carries the three-source table, that path, and
    the rule for an arm the table does not name, including terminal carriers of your own that this
    crate cannot enumerate.
    The try-leaf surface gained the `*_or_stop` shape
    (`InputRef::next_or_stop`, `try_expect_map_or_stop`, `peek_with_emitter_terminal`) so a leaf
    can report the stop without inventing a decline.

    **Derived `Debug`, `Eq` and `Hash` on `UnexpectedEnd` moved with the field.** The struct
    derives all three, so the new private `terminal: bool` appears in every `{:?}` render and
    participates in equality and hashing. A consumer with frozen renders re-blesses; a consumer
    comparing two errors that differ only in terminal status now sees them as unequal, which is
    the point. *This break shipped four rounds ago and was never disclosed anywhere until this
    entry.*

17. **`From<UnexpectedEot<L::Offset, Lang>>` is required at thirteen further sites.** The
    collection drivers stopped masking a terminal stop as a successful end, and stopped
    spinning on zero progress; both exits have to be expressible as an error, so
    `Repeated::parse`, the plain fold wings (`Fold`, `TryFold`, `TryFoldWith`, `RFold`) and the
    `Repeated` caller impls carry the conversion. A production that already names
    `ComposableParseContext` (or `FromTokenErrors`) gets this for free; one that spells its
    conversions individually adds this one.

    — *(R2, #112)*

18. **A `Sink`'s inner emitter must implement `ValueKeyedEmitter` — `Sink<Sink<E>>` is now a
    compile error.** A sink keys its bookkeeping by emitter mark; nesting one inside another
    made two independent mark spaces claim the same keys, so an abandon on the outer sink
    settled captures the inner one still owned. `ValueKeyedEmitter` is a new public marker
    trait with no members, implemented by every diagnostics emitter and deliberately not by
    `Sink`, which is what makes the nesting unrepresentable rather than documented against.

    — *(R3, #113)*

19. **`begin_point` returns a `#[must_use] SessionPointId`, and `commit_point` /
    `rollback_point` take it.** The three were argument-less, so nothing tied a settle to the
    point it settled and an out-of-order or duplicated settle silently corrupted the pin set.
    The id is branded to the handle and to the point, and four misuse conditions now panic by
    name: `no live session point`, `session point settled out of order`, `stale session point`,
    `foreign session point`.

    **Migration:** bind the return value — `let p = inp.begin_point();` — and pass it back:
    `inp.commit_point(p)` / `inp.rollback_point(p)`. Points settle newest-first.

    — *(R3, #113)*

20. **The two separator/token error carriers gained a name channel, widening
    `into_components` on both.** `MissingToken::into_components` returns a 4-tuple
    (`offset`, `expected`, `message`, **`name`**) where it returned a 3-tuple;
    `SeparatedError::into_components` returns a 3-tuple (`position`, `token`, **`name`**) where
    it returned a pair. Both types gain `with_name` and `name()`, and both derive `Eq` and
    `Hash` over the new field, so two otherwise-identical errors carrying different separator
    names no longer compare equal.

    **Migration:** add a binding for the trailing element at every `into_components`
    destructuring; `..` is not available on a tuple pattern, so this is a mechanical edit the
    compiler points at.

    — *(R4, #114)*

*The Pratt driver.* The Pratt driver ends an expression when the RHS channel says so, not when the
input position looks finished — and a report that consumes nothing can no longer be folded.

21. **`PrattRHS` gains an `End` variant.** A grammar says the expression is over on the
    same channel it uses to report operators, instead of relying on a sentinel operator
    below the minimum power. Exhaustive matches on `PrattRHS` must add an arm; the
    compile error is deliberate, which is why the enum is not `#[non_exhaustive]` — a
    wildcard arm is exactly the silent end-swallowing this change removes.

    — *(R6, #120)*

22. **The `is_eoi` loop gates are gone.** They ended the expression on a *position*,
    which a lookahead could move: a widening peek made a typed parse of `1+2` return
    `1`. The RHS channel now decides.

    — *(R6, #120)*

23. **Recursion floors are explicit.** `PrattFloor` replaces the arithmetic that
    reconstructed a floor from a power. Right-associative operators recurse at their own
    power (an off-by-one that made a right-associative pin yield 14 where 10 is correct);
    left and non-associative recurse strictly above it, which also removes the wrong
    parses the old code produced at `Power::MAX`, where the arithmetic saturated instead
    of separating. The token flavour carries its true left power rather than
    reconstructing it.

    — *(R6, #120)*

24. **`PrattPower::next` and `prev` are removed.** They were the arithmetic that made
    the floor bugs expressible; with them gone, reintroducing driver-side power
    arithmetic is a compile error rather than a review comment. This breaks callers, not
    only implementors, and no lint would have flagged them as unused — a required trait
    method warns nowhere. Note also that every in-repo implementation was non-saturating
    despite the trait's own documentation asking for saturation, so each carried a latent
    debug overflow panic.

    — *(R6, #120)*

25. **A report that consumes nothing is refused, terminally.** The typed driver checks
    committed consumption at the report boundary — after the floor and rejection logic,
    before any classify, fold, wrap, or recursion — and on a stall rolls the cycle back
    and returns a terminal `UnexpectedEoLhs` or `UnexpectedEoRhs`. Previously a
    zero-consumption report could be folded: a prefix reported after a peek recursed at
    the same position until the stack overflowed, and a zero-width infix produced
    `Ok(6)` from `1 2 3` with two phantom folds and no diagnostic on any channel.

    This adds `From<UnexpectedEoLhs<…>>` and `From<UnexpectedEoRhs<…>>` to the typed
    driver's error requirements. They are the engine's terminal exits for a
    `parse_lhs`/`parse_rhs` contract violation — ordinary operand exhaustion is still
    `UnexpectedEot` and is unchanged.

    — *(R6, #120)*

26. **The trace channel is more verbose.** With the position gate gone, the RHS channel
    is consulted at exhaustion, so traces gain the consultations the gate used to skip.
    Parse results and non-trace output are unchanged.

    — *(R6, #120)*

The token driver needs none of this: `PrattToken::try_pratt_rhs` and `try_pratt_lhs`
take only `&self` with no `InputRef`, so a report there cannot be made without
consuming, and no token fold receives an `InputRef`. That asymmetry is why the guard
lives in one driver and not the other.

*One bound per production, and the language fences.* The bound a grammar production writes is now
**one line**. Where a production previously restated every conversion its callees might need, it
names a single context bundle and the compiler elaborates the rest.

27. **`ParseCtx` is renamed `ComposableParseContext`** and completed. It now carries
    `FromTokenErrors` — the five token-level conversions as one supertrait — so the nested
    associated-type bound elaborates to callers. `ParseContext` is unchanged. The rename
    touches 59 occurrences across 14 files; the crate-root re-export set gained and lost
    nothing.

    — *(W-api-A, #118)*

28. **`FromUnclosed` replaces the per-delimiter `From<Unclosed<D, …>>` family.** One bound
    covers every delimiter pair, discriminated at runtime with a mandatory catch-all arm.
    `UnclosedEmitter::emit_unclosed`'s method bound moves with it. Type-level per-pair `From`
    impls still work alongside the umbrella, and remain the documented way to discriminate at
    the type level.

    **Migration:** delete the per-delimiter `From<Unclosed<…>>` bounds from your where-clauses
    — a residual one now fails as a bare `E0277` with no note, because `From` is a foreign
    trait we cannot annotate.

    **The discriminator is `Unclosed::kind`, not the display name.** Two further breaking
    changes carry it:

    - **`Delimiter` gains a required `const KIND: DelimiterKind`** (new, exported from
      `tokora::delimiter`). No default: a defaulted identity is one the author never chose.
    - **`Unclosed::new` and `Unclosed::of` take the kind** between the span and the name, and
      `Unclosed::kind()` reads it back. The four typed constructors (`Unclosed::paren` and
      siblings) are unchanged.

    Routing on `Unclosed::name_ref` was unsound as a dispatch key and is no longer documented
    as one. `name` is a display string with no uniqueness contract — `"[]"` is the correct name
    for *any* bracket-shaped pair — so a consumer who defined a custom pair and named it
    correctly had it silently absorbed by the built-in `Bracket` arm, reporting a character the
    source never contained. A pair tokora does not define should declare `DelimiterKind::Custom`,
    a variant that can never equal a built-in.

    **The accident is unrepresentable: `DelimiterKind`'s four built-in variants are themselves
    `#[non_exhaustive]`.** Only tokora can *write* one. `DelimiterKind::Bracket` in another
    crate is a privacy error (`E0603`) — as a `Delimiter::KIND` declaration, as the `kind`
    argument to `Unclosed::new`/`of`, anywhere — so the author who reaches for `Bracket`
    because `"[]"` was the right name for their pair no longer compiles. Matching is untouched
    at a cost of one token: **an arm outside tokora is written `DelimiterKind::Bracket { .. }`**,
    the pattern form `#[non_exhaustive]` on a variant leaves open. A `compile_fail,E0603`
    doctest on `DelimiterKind` pins it, paired with a positive control differing in one token.

    **That fences the spelling, not the value, and it is not a provenance check.** A built-in
    kind is still obtainable by a crate that is not tokora, three ways: by projecting
    `<tokora::punct::Bracket<…> as Delimiter<…>>::KIND`, since the const is public and its type
    unconstrained; by reading `Unclosed::kind` and passing it back to `Unclosed::new`/`of`; or
    from `Unclosed::bracket`/`bracket_of` and their `paren`/`brace`/`angle` siblings, which mint
    a built-in-kinded error in one public call and need no `Delimiter` impl at all. The first
    and third name tokora's own pair; the second does not — a generic adapter forwarding an
    error copies whatever kind it was handed. So a `DelimiterKind::Bracket { .. }` arm firing
    means dispatch was not keyed on a display string — not that the caller chose the kind, and
    not that the diagnostic came from tokora. All three routes are pinned
    green in `tests/unclosed_kind_dispatch.rs`, asserting the forgery succeeds, so closing one
    later breaks a line rather than making this entry quietly wrong.

    The residue is accepted deliberately. Closing the projection alone is possible — a
    `#[doc(hidden)]` provided method with a parameter type unnameable outside tokora does it,
    while a sealed supertrait plus a blanket impl over a public key trait does not compile at
    all (`E0119` against the `&D` forwarding impl) — but it leaves the other two routes open and
    buys no stronger claim. Closing all three means making the eight typed constructors
    crate-private and reshaping `new`/`of` so they cannot take a kind, which makes
    `Unclosed<char>` unconstructible outside tokora. That is refused; `DelimiterKind`'s docs
    carry the full reasoning.

    What this does **not** fix, also stated at the type: two custom pairs in one crate can still
    both declare `Custom("mine")`; and a pair the arm set forgot still lands in the catch-all —
    over a generic `D` the compile-time obligation is gone for good, and `#[non_exhaustive]`
    keeps the catch-all mandatory.

    **Migration:** replace `match err.name_ref()` with `match err.kind()` and the string
    literals with `DelimiterKind::` variants — `DelimiterKind::Bracket { .. }` for a built-in,
    braces included; add `const KIND` to any custom `Delimiter` impl —
    `DelimiterKind::Custom("your-key")`, the only variant your crate can name; add the kind
    argument to any direct `Unclosed::new`/`of` call, or reach for
    `Unclosed::bracket`/`bracket_of` and their siblings where the pair is one of tokora's.
    `name_ref` is unchanged and remains correct for rendering.

    — *(W-api-A, #118 / #121)*

29. **The `_of` language twins are gone — 167 public items removed.** Every `X::parse_of` is
    now `X::parse`, inferring `Lang` from the input. This covers 148 punctuator methods
    (74 markers × 2), `Keyword` ×8, `Ident` ×2, `Any` ×3, six free functions, and two more per
    type generated by `keyword!`. **`list_of` is renamed `list`** — it had no bare twin, so the
    suffix carried no meaning.

    *Not* collapsed, because `Lang` is genuinely unrecoverable there: `ParserContext::of` and
    `with_cache_options_of` (an emitter does not determine its own language brand), the
    argument-less constructors, and every error constructor `_of` (their `Lang` is a phantom
    brand reached only through a `From` obligation). The `one_of` family is unrelated — it
    means "one of these", not "of this language".

    **Migration:** drop the `_of` suffix. A call site that already spelled its generics gains
    one type argument, `Lang`, in last position; `_` is almost always sufficient.

    — *(W-api-A, #118)*

30. **The fluent `separated_by_*` family works for branded grammars.** It previously failed on
    `.collect()` with an error pointing frames away from its cause, because the generated
    methods hard-coded the bare marker `Comma<(), (), ()>`. They now instantiate the separator
    at the caller's language — `Comma<(), (), Lang>` — so the return type of every
    `separated_by_*` method gains that argument.

    The marker's own brand and the context language remain the **same** parameter on the
    `Punctuator` impls: a marker branded for one grammar is not a punctuator of another.
    Widening the impl is a second route to the same fix and is deliberately not taken — it
    would let a separator copy-pasted out of a sibling dialect type-check silently. The fence
    is pinned by a `compile_fail,E0277` doctest on `Punctuator`, paired with a positive
    control differing in one token.

    — *(W-api-A, #122)*

31. **`Token::Kind: 'static` is hoisted to the trait**, deleting five projection restatements.
    Four superficially similar bounds remain: they constrain the dispatch structs' own free
    `Kind` parameter, which the hoist does not reach.

    — *(W-api-A, #118)*

32. **`Parser` loses its `Error` phantom parameter** and gains value-driven entry points
    (`parse`, `parse_with`, `parse_with_state`); its constructors collapse from eight to four.

    — *(W-api-A, #118)*

33. **The delimiter side gets item 30's fix.** `Delimiter` and `TypedDelimiter`'s blanket impls
    for `Paren`, `Brace`, `Bracket` and `Angle` carried a marker-language parameter independent
    of the context language, so `Paren<(), (), LangA>` satisfied `Delimiter<'_, L, LangB>` and a
    production copy-pasted out of a sibling dialect type-checked silently. The two are now the
    **same** parameter.

    As with the separators, the widening was never what made the fluent family work. Every
    `delimited_by_*` and `try_delimited_by_*` — on `ParseInput` and on all eleven many-builder
    surfaces — now instantiates the pair at the caller's language, so their return types gain
    that argument. The seven option builders (`AtLeast`, `AtMost`, `Bounded`, and the four
    leading/trailing options) are generic only over the parser they wrap and have no language
    to name, so their four `delimited_by_*` methods take the brand as a **method** type
    parameter instead; the driving impl's `Delim: Delimiter<'inp, L, Lang>` obligation unifies
    it with the context language. A builder stored in a `let` and never driven has to name the
    brand itself.

    The pair-typed error vocabulary moves with it, or two routes to one shape would disagree on
    the error type. `parens`, `braces`, `brackets`, `angles` and their attempt twins type the
    `Unclosed` they emit on the pair at their own language, and the twelve
    `Unclosed*`/`Unopened*`/`Undelimited*` aliases plus their twelve `Lang`-generic constructor
    blocks name it the same way — `UnclosedParen<S, Lang>` is now
    `Unclosed<Paren<(), (), Lang>, S, Lang>`.

    **Migration:** at `Lang = ()` every spelling is unchanged, since `Paren` already means
    `Paren<(), (), ()>`. A branded grammar spells the pair's brand in two places: a
    `TypedDelimiter` bound forwarded through a **generic** lexer (`Bracket<(), (), Lang>:
    TypedDelimiter<'inp, L, Lang>`), and a turbofish that names the pair
    (`delimited::<Bracket<(), (), MyLang>, …>`). At a concrete lexer the impl resolves and
    neither is written. The fluent methods need nothing. The fence is pinned by two
    `compile_fail,E0277` doctests on `Delimiter`, paired with a positive control differing from
    each in one token.

    — *(W-api-A, #122)*

*Choice dispatch.* An id type whose whole purpose is to make an out-of-range branch
unrepresentable was admitting one.

35. **Array-choice branch ids are 1-based: `<[P; N] as ParseChoice>::Id` is
    `RangedUsize<1, N>`.** `RangedUsize`'s bounds are *inclusive*, so `RangedUsize<0, N>`
    admitted `N` — one past the last index — and dispatching it panicked. `[P; 0]` was worse:
    `RangedUsize<0, 0>` admits `0`, so **every** id for an empty array choice panicked.

    The repair is a bijection rather than a bounds check: exactly `N` representable values,
    `1..=N`, onto the indices `0..N`, so every id that exists is a valid index. A bounds check
    would have left the boundary value constructible and the panic reachable, which is the
    thing the ranged id was for. The audit's own suggestion — `RangedUsize<0, {N - 1}>` — is
    not writable: a generic `N` in a const operation is `error: generic parameters may not be
    used in const operations`, and `generic_const_exprs` is unstable on every supported
    toolchain.

    `[P; 0]` moves from "every dispatch panics at runtime" to "no id exists, and constructing
    one is a compile error" (`E0080`, from `deranged`'s own range assertion, at the point of
    use — an unused `[P; 0]` choice still compiles).

    **Migration:** `Id::new(i)` for the old 0-based `i` becomes `Id::new(i + 1)`, and
    `Id::get()` returns the 1-based ordinal. The boundary value that used to panic no longer
    constructs.

    The two slice impls (`[P]`, `&mut [P]`) have no compile-time repair — length is a runtime
    fact — so they gain a **named** refusal instead: `choice id {id} out of bounds for {len}
    branches` where the raw `index out of bounds` message used to be, plus the documented
    bounds the audit assumed were already there.

    — *(R10)*

*Span mutators.* `SimpleSpan` enforced its ordering invariant on one of its four mutator
surfaces. The other three assigned and added without checking, so a corrupt span was produced
silently and carried onward — and the `## Panics` sections documented panics the code did not
perform.

36. **Every `SimpleSpan` mutator the crate owns now refuses to publish a corrupt span, in every
    build.** Six `*_const` twins gained the ordering assert their non-const twins already
    carried, with the twin's byte-exact message; `bump_start_const`, `bump_end_const`,
    `bump_const` and `<Range<usize> as Span>::bump` gained an every-profile `checked_add` with
    the message `"span bump overflows usize"`; and `<SimpleSpan<O> as Span>::bump` — the
    surface this crate's own error and carrier types relocate through — gained the ordering
    assert after its delegation.

    **This turns silently-corrupt results into panics on code that runs today.** Unlike a
    refusal that rejects a correct program, these surface a defect the program is already
    carrying: `with_end_const(2)` on `(5, 15)` produced `(5, 2)`, and `bump_start_const` at
    `(MAX - 1, MAX)` produced `(0, usize::MAX)` in release with the one existing assert passing
    over the corruption. The migration line is *"your span was already inverted — here is
    where"*.

    **Two surfaces deliberately do not get an ordering assert, and the reason is a law rather
    than an omission.** `bump` shifts both ends equally, so on a well-formed span it can only
    fail under wrap; on an ill-formed one it fires on a precondition the caller did not
    violate. So the ordering assert is licensed by an impl's **construction-axis** strictness.
    `SimpleSpan` refuses inverted construction, so its assert can only catch a wrap — it stays.
    `Range<usize>` documents *lenient* construction (`Span::new(10, 5)` yields `10..5`), so an
    inverted range is a value the trait says you may create; asserting on relocation would hand
    out a value you are then not allowed to use. It keeps the overflow check only.

    The inherent `SimpleSpan::bump` also stays unguarded, and that is priced rather than
    overlooked: guarding it means adding `O: Ord`, which is a real narrowing with a reachable
    inhabitant — `SimpleSpan` derives `Default`, so `SimpleSpan::<NonOrd>::default().bump()`
    compiles and runs today. The guard sits on the `Span` impl instead, whose where-clause
    already carries `Ord`, so it costs nothing. The residue is an in-crate caller that bypasses
    the trait.

    **Stated residue, and it reaches the public non-const mutators too.** On a generic `O`,
    overflow is rustc's own check — a panic in debug, a wrap in release. `SimpleSpan::bump`,
    `bump_start` and `bump_end` are all generic, so `checked_add` is not expressible there
    (`E0599` on a type parameter), and in release the ordering assert catches a wrap **only
    when the wrapped value lands on the wrong side**. `bump_start` at `(MAX - 1, MAX)` wraps
    the start to `1`, still `<= end`, and publishes silently; `bump_end` on `(0, MAX)` wraps
    the end to `2`, still `>= start`, likewise. Both are pinned by release-profile cells, so
    the gap is visible rather than implied.

    **The checked surface for `usize` already exists, and both methods' docs now name it:** the
    `*_const` twins perform the same operation on the concrete type with a real `checked_add`,
    and a `const fn` is callable at run time. Their `## Panics` sections previously promised a
    panic the release build does not perform — the exact fiction this item exists to remove,
    which survived on these two until it was pointed out.

    Closing it *in the generic methods* needs an arithmetic bound on `Span::Offset`, which core
    cannot express — a trait definition or a dependency, plus a breaking narrowing. That stays
    a 0.9 candidate.

    The `Span` trait itself gains the written law (the two axes above) rather than a check:
    `bump` is required, so an implementor's body is theirs. `start_mut` / `end_mut` remain open
    doors by construction — an inversion written through them is unobservable to any assert on
    any mutator.

    — *(R10)*

*Rendered output.* One composition rule, applied at every carrier that violates it.

37. **Error renders say "expected" once.** `Expected`'s own `Display` opens with the word in
    every variant (`expected '}'`, `expected one of: …`), and two carriers wrote it again when
    composing one — so `MissingToken` rendered `missing token 'comma' at 5, expected expected
    '}'` and `UnexpectedToken` rendered `unexpected token, expected expected '}'`. The
    composing sites now supply only the separator.

    **`UnexpectedToken` was the unpinned one, and that is why its stutter outlived the
    repair.** Four pins recorded `MissingToken`'s doubled output as long-standing behaviour;
    `UnexpectedToken`'s renders were pinned nowhere, at any of its three shapes. Both carriers
    are fixed in one commit, and all shapes of both are now pinned byte-exactly.

    **Migration:** a consumer that freezes these renders re-blesses; the delta is exactly one
    deleted word per composed render. A consumer that converts the carriers structurally
    through `From` — which is what the reference consumer does — sees nothing.

    — *(R10)*

*Typed CST views.*

38. **`cst::Node<Lang>` binds `Syntax<Lang = Lang>`.** The supertrait list was
    `Element<Lang> + Syntax`, leaving `Syntax::Lang` free — so a type could be `Element<A> +
    Syntax<Lang = B>` and still satisfy `Node<A>`: a node claiming membership in one language
    while the `KIND` constant that says which node it *is* answers for another. Nothing rejected
    it, and the contradiction surfaced later as a cast that never matches.

    **Implementor-breaking:** a downstream `Node` impl whose brands disagree stops compiling.
    That is the fix. Every in-tree impl and the reference consumer brand coherently already.

    — *(R10)*

*Test-support surface.* Last, because it is opt-in: the `fuzz` feature's alphabet is public
API and moved like any other.

39. **`fuzz::Op` gains an `IsExhausted` variant.** The fuzz alphabet tracks the real public
    input surface one-for-one, so `InputRef::is_exhausted()` earned an op. `Op` is an ordinary
    exhaustive enum: a downstream `match` over `Op::ALL` without a wildcard arm stops
    compiling, which is deliberate — the same compile-time exhaustiveness prod the crate's own
    `Op::label` relies on. `Op::COUNT` moves with it, and the variant was inserted in surface
    order rather than appended, so the fieldless discriminants of every later variant shift by
    one. Nothing in the crate casts them and `Op` carries no `#[repr]`, so the values were
    never a contract — recorded because a mechanical API diff reports them and a reader should
    not have to wonder whether it matters.

    *This item exists because a `cargo semver-checks` run against the published 0.7.3 found
    it, and no PR body, commit message or surface grep had.*

*Diagnostic counts on the recovering path.* Last in this list because it removes a report
rather than adding one, and only where that report was a duplicate.

40. **A wrong opening delimiter is reported once, not twice.** All four delimited many-drivers
    (`repeated`, `repeated_while`, `separated`, `separated_while`) probe the opener, and on a
    wrong token they record it as an expected-open `UnexpectedToken` and leave it **cached and
    unconsumed**. The close-position probe later re-saw that same cached token and reported it
    a second time, as an expected-close miss. Under a recording emitter both landed; the two
    entries carried an identical span.

    The report is now suppressed **iff the emitter's log still holds a live report naming that
    front token** — and the witness for that is a **lineage fact on the input**, not a flag in the
    driver's stack frame.

    That distinction is the substance of the fix. "Has this token already been reported?" is a
    *transactional* question, and a parser's stack frame has no rollback semantics. A driver-local
    flag — committed position, with or without a re-key counter beside it — cannot observe a
    restore, because a restore is exactly the operation that erases frame-visible traces: it
    rewinds the emitter, destroys the stream's front, and returns position to a value the frame
    cannot tell apart from "nothing happened". Three successive frame-local witnesses were built
    and each leaked, always toward the same failure: a **deleted** diagnostic.

    So `Input` now carries a front-report watermark. `Some(end)` means the emitter's current log
    holds an unexpected-token report whose subject is the token the current regime lexes at the
    stream front, ending at `end`. Three writers keep that inductive, and no others: it is
    published by the same body that appends the report and only if the append succeeded; it is
    cleared by a re-key, before the cache clear, so an unwind through that caller code leaves it
    disarmed and a later arm emits; and it is captured into every `Checkpoint` and restored in the
    same no-caller-code block as the emitter rewind. A rollback below the flag truncates the report
    and disarms the watermark as one state; a rollback above it keeps both, because the report
    predates the mark.

    The general law, now stated in the cell census: **a witness must share the rollback semantics
    of the fact it witnesses.** The cache-push counter is restored because a restore drops exactly
    the entries it counts; this watermark is restored because its subject is the emission log, and
    the log is restored in the same move.

    A close miss naming a **different** token, or arriving once the report for the flagged one is
    no longer live, is untouched: `"{1 2 x"`-shaped input keeps both of its reports.

    Because the predicate reads input state rather than a driver local, all eight close-miss arms
    ask it with one identical line — so uniformity across the drivers is a property of the
    mechanism rather than a claim about each driver's control flow.

    **Only recording emitters are affected.** Under a fail-fast emitter the first emit aborts
    the driver, so the second report never existed there and no `Fatal`-path behaviour moves.
    What changes is any assertion that counted diagnostics on the recovering path.

    The suppression is applied at **all eight** `CloseStatus::WrongToken` arms across the four
    drivers, not only the four that today's tests reach — gating a subset is how a fixed defect
    relocates to its own sibling.

    — *(R11, D43(b))*

*The Pratt engines' recursion budget, and the non-associative contract.* Appended after item 40
rather than renumbered into the Pratt group at 21–26, because every number in this section is a
live cross-reference. Inside the group the breaks that do not fail to compile come first, as
everywhere else.

41. **A non-associative operator that repeats is a syntax error, where it used to fold left in
    silence.** Once a frame has folded a `PrattInfix::Neither` operator at
    power `p`, a second *infix* operator at exactly `p` — whatever its own associativity — now
    fails the parse with `NonAssociativeChain`, with the offending operator left on the input
    unconsumed. Both engines raise it, on the same trigger, with the same restored posture, and it
    is **returned** rather than emitted, so no recording emitter and no rewind can absorb it.

    Previously the repeat was simply admitted. At the top level that merely left a tail behind —
    `1 ; 2 ; 3` folded to `(1;2)` — but nested, it had no caller-side remedy at all:
    `7 = 1 ; 2 ; 3` returned `Ok(((7=(1;2));3))` with the **whole input consumed**, so nothing was
    left over for an end-of-input check to catch. That shape is the reason this is an error and not
    an ending. Non-associativity is a property of a *chain*, and the only frame that knows the
    chain exists is the one holding the latch; hand the operator up instead and the recipient is
    the same engine one frame up, which sees an ordinary admissible operator, folds it by its own
    rules, and re-associates the chain across itself. It is structurally incapable of knowing the
    constraint.

    **The contract is per-operator, not whole-chain fixity resolution.** The latch is cleared by
    folding an infix at a different power and is untouched by a postfix fold, so `a == b < c` —
    this variant, then `Left` at the same power — is rejected while `a < b == c` is accepted.

    **Not terminal**, deliberately: this is malformed input, the classic recovery target, so
    `Recover`, `InplaceRecover` and `skip_then_retry` may spend it. A grammar that wants the old
    fold-once-then-stop behaviour asks for it in grammar code — wrap the pratt parser in a recovery
    combinator, or reclassify the operator `Left` — because tolerance is a caller policy and not a
    silent engine default. Where a repeat coincides with a zero-consumption report, item 25's stall
    outranks it: the report boundary is checked first, since a driver must not diagnose a chain
    built out of a contract violation.

    — *(R12; the two exits ranked in R13)*

42. **Recursive descent is bounded, and the bound is on by default.** Both Pratt engines enter one
    level per live frame through the new `InputRef::descend`, whose `Descent` guard releases the
    level on **every** exit of the frame — return, `?`, or unwind, identically in `std` and
    `no_std` — and exceeding the budget fails the parse with the always-terminal
    `RecursionLimitReached`. It too is returned rather than emitted, so a tripped budget cannot
    reach a caller as a truncated-but-successful parse.

    Previously the descent was bounded only by the token count, which is not a bound a *machine*
    has. The red-before probe for this item did not fail an assertion; it **aborted the test
    process** with `fatal runtime error: stack overflow`.

    The budget is per *input session* rather than per parser — two expression parsers composed into
    one grammar draw on one depth, which is what makes it a bound on native stack use rather than
    on any single production — and it is configured with the new
    `InputContext::with_recursion_limiter` / `ParserContext::with_recursion_limiter`.
    **`RecursionLimiter::unlimited()` restores 0.7.3's behaviour exactly**, at 0.7.3's risk.

    **The default is 64, and it is sized against the tightest measured configuration rather than
    the most generous one.** Bisected on this tree, one pratt frame per level, on an explicitly
    sized **2 MiB** thread — what `std::thread::spawn` and every libtest harness thread gets, and
    so the smallest stack a parse is likely to run on:

    | build | typed driver | token driver |
    |---|---|---|
    | release (`opt-level = 3`) | 3871 frames | 4247 frames |
    | debug (`opt-level = 0`) | 384 frames | **125 frames** |

    The binding cell is the debug token driver at 125, not the release figures above it, and the
    asymmetry is the whole argument: a limit that is too low returns a clean, catchable error
    naming the knob that raises it, while one that is too high aborts the process with no
    diagnostic and takes the suite with it. Only one of those is recoverable, so the default is set
    where every measured configuration survives. 64 is the largest power of two leaving ~1.9×
    margin under 125, and it clears the other three cells by 6×, 60× and 66×. A grammar parsing
    untrusted, deeply nested input should still set its own limit against the stack the parse will
    actually run on, rather than inherit this one.

    **Your own recursive combinators draw on the same budget, and `InputRef::descending` is how.**
    It takes the frame's body as a closure and owns the level for exactly that body:

    ```rust,ignore
    inp.descending(|inp| match remaining {
      0 => Ok(inp.recursion().depth()),
      n => nested(inp, n - 1),
    })
    ```

    The closure's error is returned untouched, so `?` inside composes with whatever the frame
    already returns and the trip is built as the frame's own error type; a body written entirely
    as the closure keeps its `return`s; a panic releases the level on the unwind. Nothing the
    closure can write releases it earlier — it is handed the input, never the guard, and
    `InputRef::recursion` is read-only.

    **`InputRef::descend` is also public, as the low-level escape hatch, and it is easy to write
    wrong.** It hands the level back as an ordinary value, so *where the level ends is caller
    code*. `Descent` is `#[must_use]`, which catches **one** spelling of getting that wrong and
    not the others. Measured on this tree at limitation 8, over 200 recursive calls, with the
    abort depth bisected one process per depth on a 2 MiB thread:

    | frame body | diagnostic | at 200 calls | aborts by |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | `inp.descending(\|inp\| …)` | — | `Err(RecursionLimitReached { depth: 9, limitation: 8 })` | never |
    | `let mut frame = inp.descend()?; let inp = &mut *frame;` | — | same | never |
    | `inp.descend()?;` | `unused_must_use` | `Ok`, depth 0 | 5 000 |
    | `let _ = inp.descend()?;` | none | `Ok`, depth 0 | 5 000 |
    | `if inp.descend().is_ok() { … }` | none | `Ok`, depth 0 | 5 000 |
    | `let d = inp.descend()?.recursion().depth();` | none | `Ok`, depth 1 | 4 000 |
    | `drop(inp.descend()?);` | none | `Ok`, depth 0 | 5 000 |

    An abort is `fatal runtime error: stack overflow` — the failure this whole item exists to
    delete, reinstated by a line that compiles. The abort depths are a demonstration rather than
    a constant: they are one debug build's frame size, probed at 1 000-level steps, and one row
    moved a whole step between two builds of the same source. The four silent rows are **not a
    closed list**:
    any expression that consumes the guard and lets it die before the recursion behaves the same
    way, and rustc's own `help:` on the caught row suggests the second one. Early release cannot
    be forbidden, because it is sometimes what a frame wants, so what closes the question is the
    *shape*: `descending` makes the level's scope and the body the same region by construction,
    the bound guard makes them the same region by discipline. What the type system guarantees on
    its own — for both spellings — is *balance* (every level entered is left exactly once, by the
    destructor, unwind included) and that a **live** guard is the only route to the input.

    Rails: `tests/ui/descent_dropped_early.rs` pins the attribute on the MSRV toolchain,
    `src/input/input_ref/descent_tests.rs` pins every row of the table above at runtime on every
    toolchain, and its `#[expect(unused_must_use, …)]` turns a deleted attribute into a hard error
    under the crate's `deny(warnings)`.

    — *(R12; the default resized against measurement in R13; the guard marked `#[must_use]` in
    R22; `descending` added and the other three early-release shapes measured in R23)*

43. **`RecursionLimiter`'s default depth was dropped from 500 to 64 in every constructor that
    supplies one, then reverted before release.** `RecursionLimiter::new` and its `Default`, and
    `Limiter::new` / `Limiter::with_token_tracker` — which build one for you — carried the 64
    default only during the campaign. [50](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) returned all four to 500
    before 0.8.0 shipped: what 0.8.0 ships is 500 for every one of them, and only `ParserContext`
    and the input layer keep 64 — neither routes through these constructors. This entry is kept
    because [50](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) and the migration table's row for these four
    constructors both rely on the reasoning below — read the two together, and act on 50.

    **The reasoning:** these four constructors reach code with no pratt parser in it. The same
    type doubles as a **lexer-side** nesting tracker in a `State` / `Extras` position, where it
    counts lexing nesting, costs no native stack, and where 500 was never sized against anything.
    Had the drop shipped, a lexer that inherited the default and nested deeper than 64 would have
    tripped where it had not before.

    Spell the limit you meant with `RecursionLimiter::with_limitation`. The one `500` this round
    left standing in the docs was the lexer-extras example in `Limiter`'s own documentation, kept
    deliberately: there the number is the example's explicit choice rather than a default, and the
    two subjects are worth keeping apart.

    — *(R13)*

44. **`NonAssociativeChain`'s offset is *defined* as the handback position** — the driver's own
    restore target — and not a position measured anywhere near the offending operator. `1 ; 2 ; 3`
    reports **5**, where a formulation written earlier in this campaign reported 6.

    The definition is checkable rather than descriptive, and that is the point of it: catch the
    error and **`InputRef::span().end()` *is* the offset**. Everything from that byte onward is
    still available to the caller — including whatever the deciding read had consumed before it was
    handed back.

    That identity is about the **handback**, and it is not a statement about where a recovery
    combinator restarts. `Recover` and `skip_then_retry` speculate through `try_attempt`, whose
    failure path restores the pre-attempt checkpoint before the handler runs or the skip loop
    starts, so both resume at their own attempt origin instead; `InplaceRecover` never backtracks
    and is the one that stands where the offset names. Measured on `1 ; 2 ; 3` with the whole pratt
    parser wrapped, where the error carries 5: catching the `Err` yourself reads 5,
    `inplace_recover` reads 5, `recover` reads **0**, and `skip_then_retry` scans forward from
    **0** — its first sync candidate is the `1` at 0 and its first skipped region is `0..1`.

    Reading it as a pointer at the operator is wrong in four ordinary shapes, each measured:
    whitespace the lexer skips (`1 ; 2 ; 3` — offset 5, the repeat at 6); whitespace surfaced as
    trivia *tokens* and skipped by the classifier (offset 5, the repeat at 8); an operator spelled
    with two tokens (offset 7, head at 8, tail at 10); and a non-fatal lexer error, reported and
    stepped over (offset 5, the repeat at 8). Naming the operator would describe a position no
    caller was ever left at, and would invite a recoverer resuming there to discard the region in
    between — in the last shape, the lexer error's own bytes together with the diagnostic that was
    rewound with the aborted probe and is due to be re-emitted. The operator's head is not
    obtainable in general anyway: `parse_pratt_rhs` holds a whole `InputRef` and decides for itself
    where its operator begins, so the only way to learn what it would skip is to run it — and the
    repeat has to be decided before it may.

    **`Display` names it the same way**, because the text is what a caller who never calls
    `offset()` still has: `non-associative operator cannot be chained at its own power; input
    handed back at 5, at or before the operator`. It does not report the operator's position,
    for the reason above — the engine does not have it. See *Debug and rendered output*.

    — *(R14 defined it, R15 made the number the restore target)*

45. **`InputContext::into_components` returns `(E, C, RecursionLimiter)`** where it returned
    `(E, C)`. The context carries the recursion budget now, and a decomposition that dropped it
    would hand the input an unconfigured one. `InputContext::new`'s arity is unchanged — the budget
    defaults, and `with_recursion_limiter` sets it — so only the destructuring moves, and `..` is
    not available on a tuple pattern, so the compiler points at every site.

    — *(R12)*

46. **Both Pratt engines require two more conversions from a grammar's error type.** The token
    engine's `pratt`, `pratt_with_min_precedence` and `pratt_in`, and the typed driver's
    `ParseInput::parse_input` impl block, gain `From<RecursionLimitReached<L::Offset, Lang>>` and
    `From<NonAssociativeChain<L::Offset, Lang>>`. Two `From` impls on your error type; every
    example and bench in this repo carries the shape.

    **`From`, and not a `FromPrattError` method, because these two never pass through an
    emitter.** Neither has an `emit_*` counterpart on `PrattEmitter`, by design — a recording
    emitter must not be able to swallow a resource trip or a rejected chain — so the engines
    *return* them, and a returned error becomes the caller's type through `From`. The trip's
    value is built and converted at `InputRef::descending` / `InputRef::descend`, the recursion
    entry every recursive-descent grammar shares whether or not it has a pratt parser in it; the
    repeat is built by each engine at its own exit. Neither point has an emitter in scope, so a
    conversion method on the emitter-side bundle would be one nothing could ever call.
    `FromPrattError`
    keeps exactly the two conversions a `PrattEmitter` body performs, and **no hand-written
    `FromPrattError` impl has to change.**

    The choice this obligation carries is unchanged, only its spelling: an impl that *stores* the
    trip keeps its payload — offset, depth, limitation — readable, and its always-terminal marker
    readable through `MaybeTerminal`; one that discards it loses both. What discarding no longer
    costs is the **stop**: item 48 moved the resource-trip witness onto the input session, where no
    `From` the grammar writes can reach it. Both are legitimate, and a `From` impl is the author's
    own code either way, so neither is picked for you.

    — *(R12, R21)*

47. **A gap is now tiled where it opens — in the node of the token it trails — not where it is
   noticed.** Where an uncovered run of source bytes lands no longer depends on what happens
   after the run is already determined. A run used to be tiled at the token that *revealed* it,
   or, for the **trailing** run, at the end of the walk; both are moments at which the parse may
   have left the node it was in when it stopped covering the source. So the same garbage produced
   two tree shapes, chosen by whether more input happened to follow: for a lossless dialect the
   tail landed *outside* the document node while identical garbage mid-document landed inside it.

   The rule now: an uncovered run opens the instant the token before it settles, and it is tiled
   there, in the node open at that moment. It is in the tree before the next event is read, so
   nothing that follows can move it. One clause covers the run that **no token precedes** — a
   source starting with bytes no token claims — which tiles where the walk first sees it: at the
   first committed token, or, if the parse committed no token at all, at the end of the walk in
   whatever node is open there.

   `Root[Document[Tok] Gap]` is now `Root[Document[Tok Gap]]`, and the node **widens over** the
   run it takes — a `Document@0..11` before a four-byte tail is `Document@0..15` after. A run
   nested deeper goes deeper: it lands at the depth of the token it trails, not one level below
   the root by fiat.

   Two placement laws hold by construction and are pinned over a corpus rather than as examples.
   *Appending a token never moves a gap*: two streams sharing a prefix through the token a run
   trails place that run in the same node, including when one of them stops there. *Hoisting a
   lexer error never moves a gap*: placement reads the token and structure events only. The
   second matters because a prefilled lookahead cache emits the lexer errors it crosses when it
   crosses them, so prefetching moves such a diagnostic earlier in the event stream — the token
   stream is exactly invariant under prefill and the diagnostic stream is not, and a rule reading
   a diagnostic's position would make the tree a function of how far the caller peeked.

   Unchanged: a **leading** run still tiles at the first token that follows it, inside whatever
   node that token lands in; a run trailing a root-level token stays a root child; a source with
   **nothing lexable in it** keeps its run beside the document node (`Root[Document@0..0,
   Gap@0..len]`), because there is no token for it to trail and the identical parse with one
   lexable byte appended puts it at the root too; and
   [`finish_partial`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/cst/struct.Sink.html#method.finish_partial)
   on an **unbalanced** stream still tiles a token-less run into the innermost *open* node. On a
   balanced stream both doors agree, as they did before.

   `tree.text() == source` is untouched: every uncovered byte still tiles, byte-exactly, under
   every one of these placements. Only the shape moved.

   **Re-bless any snapshot of a tree built over a source with an uncovered run that follows a
   committed token** — a truncated parse, an unterminated string or block string, a stray
   unlexable punctuator after real input. Consumers that walk by text see no change; consumers
   that walk by node, or that assert on a rendered tree, see the run inside the node of the token
   before it. A source with *no* committed token at all is not affected.

48. **A recursion-limit trip is now terminal for every grammar error type, `()` included — neither
   recovery nor a collection driver's failure path can spend it.** Two more of a collection
   driver's exits can reach a construct's end without the trip ever surfacing as an `Err`, and both
   close later in this entry: an element's absence exit (item 56) and a real closer committed just
   after one (item 57). A fourth exit does not close, and is not going to: an element that catches
   the trip and still answers `Accept` spends it, for every error type, on purpose. Decline lets
   the *driver* manufacture the construct's end from a stop the caller is never told about, which is
   why the driver has to guard its own conclusion; `Accept` means the *element* produced the value,
   and the driver is faithfully collecting what it was handed, not concluding anything of its own.
   tokora cannot stop a grammar from catching an error and returning a value without diagnosing
   it — true of every error a grammar can catch and answer, not only this one — so gating `Accept`
   would forbid a value-producing element from ever recovering from a budget it deliberately
   caught: a broader contract than #148 establishes. Item 56 states the exemption at the point it
   first applies; `parser::many`'s module docs carry it as the standing contract, not an
   afterthought.

   This closes 0.8.0's [known limitation — a discarding error sink erased
   the recursion trip's stop, not its
   bound](#0.8.0-known-limitation-recorded-and-closed-before-release--a-discarding-error-sink-erased-the-recursion-trips-stop-not-its-bound),
   which recorded the behaviour rather than answering it. The answer is that a resource bound an
   unrelated error sink can opt out of is not a bound.

   [`RecursionLimitReached`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/error/struct.RecursionLimitReached.html)
   has always been terminal for every value, but
   [`recover`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/trait.ParseInput.html#method.recover),
   [`inplace_recover`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/trait.ParseInput.html#method.inplace_recover)
   and
   [`skip_then_retry`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/trait.ParseInput.html#method.skip_then_retry)
   read that off the **converted** value — after the grammar's `From` had run. A `From` that
   discards the payload discards the marker with it, so a `()`-errored grammar got
   `is_terminal() == false` back and recovery **spent** the trip.

   **Where resource terminality is stored now:** on the **input session**, in a monotone counter
   (`Input::resource_trips`, crate-internal, bumped by
   [`InputRef::descend`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/input/struct.InputRef.html#method.descend)'s
   trip arm before the grammar's `From` runs, so a panicking conversion cannot skip it). The three
   combinators read it **beside** `MaybeTerminal::is_terminal`. No conversion the grammar writes
   can reach it, and nothing lowers it: a `Checkpoint` does not carry it and a restore does not
   touch it. Grammar error conversion therefore cannot affect it — which is the question 0.8.0's
   entry left open, answered here in the terms it asked for.

   **What the cell records and what the combinators test are different questions, deliberately.**
   The cell is a session fact — *this parse exceeded a budget, this many times* — and it is never
   cleared, because nothing can un-exceed a budget. Every site that consults it is judging **one
   attempt**, so it snapshots the counter before that attempt and re-raises only when the count
   moved *during* it. The two answers come apart exactly where grammar code catches a trip itself
   and parses on: the session has tripped forever after, while the next attempt is an ordinary one.
   Reading the session fact there would refuse recovery — and, below, emit-and-continue — for every
   later failure in the document, ordinary syntax errors included. A real trip is still re-raised
   wherever one happens, a second trip after a caught first one included.

   **What changes for you, and only if your error type discards the value:**

   | your grammar's error type | before | now |
   |---|---|---|
   | stores it and delegates `is_terminal` | re-raised | re-raised — **unchanged** |
   | `()`, or any `From` that drops it | recovery ran; `skip_then_retry` skipped and committed | re-raised |

   Concretely, measured on one ladder and one 32-deep input: `.recover(..)` used to return
   `Ok(<the recoverer's synthesized value>)` and now returns `Err`; `.skip_then_retry(..)` used to
   hand the surrounding grammar back offset **68** — the whole chain and the sync token consumed
   and committed — and now hands back **0**, which is the number a delegating error type always
   read. Same ladder, same limit, two error types, one answer.

   **If you relied on the old behaviour**, the fix is the budget, not the sink: raise it with
   [`with_recursion_limiter`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/struct.ParserContext.html#method.with_recursion_limiter).
   Recovering from an exhausted depth budget was never sound — no quantity of skipped input makes
   the next descent shallower, so those cycles spent input for a verdict they could not change. If
   you want the trip's *details* (offset, depth, limitation), that still requires an error type
   that stores the value; the discarding sink loses the payload exactly as before.

   **The same stop now also reaches the resilient collection loops — and that half was never
   sink-dependent.** `repeated`, `separated` and their delimited forms swallow an element's `Err`
   by design: emit it as a diagnostic and keep looping. Their gate re-raised the frontier
   `Incomplete` and the *scanner*'s committed boundary, and a descent trip latches neither — it has
   a control stack rather than a position, so there is no boundary for it to latch. A trip inside
   an element was therefore filed as an ordinary diagnostic and the loop went on to the next one,
   bounded only by the no-progress guard. Unlike the recovery half above, that happened for **every**
   error type: a delegating one was spent there exactly as `()` was. The gate reads the session
   counter too now — and, like the recovery half, it reads it against a baseline taken **once per
   element**, so what re-raises is a trip *that element* caused.

   | driving an element whose own attempt hands the trip back as `Err` | before | now |
   |---|---|---|
   | `repeated()`, `separated_by(..)`, and both delimited forms | the trip filed as a diagnostic; the loop continued to the next element and returned `Ok` with whatever it collected | the collection returns `Err` at the first trip, with **nothing filed** |
   | the same, for an element that fails **ordinarily** after some earlier construct's trip was caught and parsed past | the failure filed as a diagnostic; the loop continued | unchanged — the failure filed as a diagnostic; the loop continues |

   **This half changes behaviour for delegating and discarding error types alike**, so a grammar
   that used to receive a truncated-with-diagnostics container over a too-deep input now receives a
   failed parse. The remedy is the same one as above and for the same reason: raise the budget with
   `with_recursion_limiter`. A container assembled from elements the budget forbade reading was
   never a description of the input, and the diagnostic that named the trip was filed against a
   construct the parse had already been told to stop reading.

   **The scope of the change, stated rather than left to be found: it is the element's own trip
   that ends the collection, not the session's.** A parse that catches a trip and goes on keeps
   emit-and-continue recovery for the constructs after it — which is what an editor or language
   server needs, since one deeply-nested expression must not suppress the rest of the file's
   diagnostics. The same holds one nesting level up: an inner collection's trip that an element
   swallows is not charged to the enclosing collection's next ordinary failure.

   **The granularity floor, because "the constructs after it" has a resolution.** The witness is a
   counter, and a counter proves that *a* trip happened during the unit being judged — not that the
   error being judged *is* that trip. The unit is one attempt for `recover` and `inplace_recover`,
   one retry cycle for `skip_then_retry`, and one **element** for the collections. So grammar code
   that catches a trip itself and then fails **ordinarily inside that same unit** has the ordinary
   failure re-raised rather than recovered or filed. Move the catch one construct further out and
   it recovers, or is filed and looped past, exactly as an untripped parse would; that contrast is
   pinned by a test on each side of it.

   The floor **fails closed** at the recovery, failure, absence and real-closer gates: a real trip
   that reaches one of them is never recovered from and never filed as a diagnostic, and the only
   over-charged case is an ordinary failure that shares its unit with a caught trip. It says nothing
   about `Accept`, the fourth exit above: an element that catches a trip and still answers `Accept`
   spends it, for every error type, on purpose.

   The floor cannot be lowered by reading the error, because the error type is allowed to be `()` and
   discard the trip — which is why the witness is on the input in the first place. Lowering it
   needs a cooperative *rebaseline* published for code that deliberately catches a trip and wants
   the enclosing baseline moved past it. That is not in this release; no public name changes if it
   is ever added.

49. **An unpaired settle in the CST `Sink` now panics in release builds too, instead of silently
   shearing the two logs.** `<Sink as Emitter>::rewind` was already a wall against a *truncating
   rewind to a mid-log mark no live row captured* — a mark `checkpoint()` never returned, or one
   whose capture an earlier `rewind`/`release` already spent. That wall was
   `debug_assertions`-only. It is now unconditional.

   The reasoning it was built on had a hole. The debug-only posture deferred upward: the input
   layer's own LIFO witness was said to reject the condition on every input-mediated path, so the
   sink only needed a second wall for undisciplined raw use. But that witness is *itself*
   `debug_assertions`-gated, so a release build had no wall on **either** layer. What a release
   build did instead was keep the sink's own channels exact and leave the inner emitter untouched
   — the event log and the diagnostic log silently out of step, with nothing recording that they
   were. That is bounded only for as long as materialization reads the whole log in one pass at
   the end; anything that hands part of the tree onward before the parse finishes turns it into a
   wrong tree that no consumer can detect.

   The condition is a **parser bug and cannot be provoked by input**: a malformed document
   changes which branches run, not whether a branch settles its own capture exactly once. So
   hardening it cannot turn a bad document into a crash — verified across the malformed and
   truncated-prefix corpora, which produce the recovery holes and rewinds this touches and whose
   tree hashes are unchanged.

   **`release` is deliberately *not* hardened with it**, and that is the one asymmetry to be aware
   of. Its two non-top outcomes are specified behaviour rather than violations, mirroring
   `InputRef::commit`'s documented cost model: removing a row that is not the innermost is the
   "linear removal" that method already promises when a younger capture is still live, and finding
   no row at all is its "harmless no-op … (no panic, in any build)". Settles are newest-first only
   *within* a family — guards and session points interleave by design — so an out-of-stack-order
   release is lawful. Making either loud would convert a documented guarantee into a crash.

   **The panic is raised before the rewind's first mutation.** A wall placed after the damage
   only narrates it. The condition is decided by a read-only preflight over the unchanged mark
   stack, ahead of the row spend, the `events.truncate`, the undo journal's reverse replay and
   the era ledger's truncation record — every one of which the violating call used to have
   already performed by the time the check fired. A host that `catch_unwind`s the panic therefore
   keeps the sink it had, on every channel, instead of one whose event log was rewound and whose
   inner emitter was not; `finish_partial` on such a sink used to return that sheared state as a
   perfectly ordinary tree, with a `gap_kind` tile standing where the dropped token had been.

   **A panic already unwinding is exempt, and this is load-bearing rather than a hedge.**
   `Emitter::rewind` can run from a rolling-back guard's `Drop`, and a panic raised there is a
   *double* panic: the process aborts outright — no unwinding, no `catch_unwind`, signal 6. That
   is strictly worse than the shear being reported. The report is therefore suppressed when
   `std::thread::panicking()` is true — but suppressing the *report* is not licence to degrade
   invisibly, and this is where the mid-unwind path changed as well. It no longer leaves the sink
   half-rewound. It degrades to a **total no-op on every channel** (the sink has no correct
   rewind to perform, so it performs none, and both logs are left describing the same history)
   and **latches** the fact. `Emitter::rewind`'s contract is amended to state the general rule:
   what an implementation must never do is **abort**, so an emitter that can *detect* an unpaired
   settle may report it by panicking, provided it checks `std::thread::panicking()` first, raises
   before it mutates, and records any report it had to suppress.

   **New: `FinishError::UnpairedSettle { mark, len }`.** The latch is what a caller sees. After a
   degraded rewind, **both** materialization doors refuse — `finish` and `finish_partial` alike,
   because a log describing a rollback that never happened is corruption, not the incompleteness
   `finish_partial` exists to tolerate. A typed error rather than a panic, following the posture
   the neighbouring emission-time walls already take (a detect-at-cause assert, with a typed
   `FinishError` as the backstop at materialization) and preserving `finish`'s documented
   never-panics guarantee. `FinishError` is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so the new variant is additive;
   a `match` that does not name it keeps compiling.

   **What to expect if you are affected.** A parser that was quietly relying on the release-build
   degradation now panics at the cause with `Sink rewind to a mid-log mark with no captured row`.
   The fix is always at the call site, not here: some capture is being settled twice, or a mark is
   being rewound to after it was released. Debug builds and `cargo test` already panicked on it,
   so a parser whose backtracking paths are exercised in tests will see no change. Note also that
   `InputRef::restore`'s release-build promise is narrowed to match: it still makes no panic of its
   own after an out-of-order raw restore, but the *emitter* it hands the violation to keeps its own
   posture, and the `Sink`'s is now loud in every build. One consequence is documented rather than
   removed: a raw restore the sink refuses is **not itself transactional**. The emitter's state is
   untouched, but `restore` raises from the middle of its own rollback, so the checkpoint lineage
   has been popped through the target while the position and the reporting witnesses have not been
   restored. That is inside the "unspecified but bounded" envelope the method already documents,
   it is reachable only through the double-settle bug being reported, and it is now pinned by a
   test rather than assumed away.

50. **`RecursionLimiter::new` and the combined `Limiter`'s defaults return to 500 too — only
    `ParserContext` and the input layer keep 64.** The 500 → 64 drop above landed on one constant
    shared by more subjects than it should have. `RecursionLimiter::new` (and `Default`) is the
    tracker's own general-purpose depth, with no assumption about what a level costs.
    `ParserContext` and the input layer are the only two places a level IS a live native-stack
    frame: each holds its own `RecursionLimiter`, sized against a measured debug-build ceiling,
    for the budget a Pratt-driven parse actually descends against. `Limiter::new` and
    `Limiter::with_token_tracker` requested that same 64 by construction, but fed neither one —
    `Limiter` is not part of tokora's own parser wiring anywhere in this crate. Like bare
    `RecursionLimiter`, it is documented as usable directly as a lexer's `State`/`Extras` nesting
    tracker, where a level costs no native stack at all, and both of those lexer-facing paths
    inherited 64 anyway, tripping on a number chosen for a reason that does not apply to either.

    `RecursionLimiter::new`/`Default`, `Limiter::new`/`Default`, and `Limiter::with_token_tracker`
    all give back 500, unconditionally. Only `ParserContext` and the input layer still request
    the native-stack-safe 64 explicitly, from the crate-private
    `RecursionLimiter::PARSE_DEFAULT_DEPTH` — neither one holds a `Limiter` or calls
    `RecursionLimiter::new`, so neither can silently fall back to the general-purpose default,
    and a Pratt-driven parse still gets exactly the protection it had. Everywhere else changes: a
    tracker built through `RecursionLimiter::new`, `Limiter::new`, `Limiter::with_token_tracker`,
    or `#[derive(Default)]` over either type, with no parser anywhere near it, trips at 500
    again, not 64. That includes the depth set by [43](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) above for
    `Limiter::new` and `Limiter::with_token_tracker` — the same lexer-side reasoning
    that moved bare `RecursionLimiter::new` applies to them equally, and was missed there the
    first time. Spell the limit you meant with `RecursionLimiter::with_limitation` if 500 is
    still wrong for your grammar or your lexer.

68. **A CST parse mints its own sink from the source it reads, and no callback anywhere in the
    crate is handed the emitter again.** `cst::parse_lossless` and `cst::parse_lossless_partial`
    are now the **only** doors onto a recording sink: each takes the source once and hands that
    one argument to both the `Sink` it mints and the `Input` it drives, so the two names a
    caller used to be able to state independently — one at `Sink::new`, one at the parse entry —
    are the same argument of the same call. `Sink::new` is `pub(crate)` now; the type keeps its
    public name only as the thing a spent handle wraps. What a driver hands back is not a `Sink`
    but a `Cst<'inp, L, E>` — `finish`, `finish_partial` and the `with_trivia_policy` builder
    move here from `Sink` — and `Cst` **deliberately implements no emitter trait**, so the
    artefact a driver returns cannot be fed back in as a second parse's context. Minting closes
    the construction half of the wrong-source class; the handle's missing `Emitter` impl closes
    the return half.

    **A finish-time wall against the construction half was built during this campaign and
    removed before release.** It caught a naive wrapper, and each of three further shapes — an
    all-diagnostic parse, pre-arming through the public `bound_source` query, and a hand-emitted
    `cst_token` span — was then found to walk around it: every fix relocated the hole rather
    than closing it, *because the witness was flags on the sink and the sink cannot tell who set
    them*. See the known limitation below (revised in place for this item) for the full history
    and for what minting still does not reach.

    **The emitter never reaches a callback either, and that closes the same class from the other
    side.** `&mut Ctx::Emitter` **is** an emitter: code holding one could wrap it in a type of
    its own and install that wrapper as a second parse's context over a different buffer, which
    re-opens from inside exactly the hole minting just closed at the entry. Every public callback
    that used to take `&mut Ctx::Emitter` now takes an `EmitterView<'a, 'inp, L, E, Lang>`
    instead: `Decision::decide` (the condition of every `*_while` combinator), `ParseInput::peek_then`'s
    handler, `ParseChoice::peek_then_choice` and `peek_then_try_choice`'s handler, and the three
    token-level pratt folds, `PrattFoldTokenPrefix`/`Infix`/`Postfix`. (`peek_then_head`'s own
    handler takes no emitter parameter at all, before or after, so it is unaffected.) A view
    implements no emitter trait, does not `Deref`, and hands back no `&mut E` — there is nothing
    at the end of a method call to put in an emitter slot, and the value itself cannot stand in
    one. Its 24 forwarded methods carry the emitter's own names, so a callback body written
    against `&mut E` keeps every statement it had; only the parameter's type changes. **Five**
    members stay off the surface — `Emitter::checkpoint`, `rewind` and `release` (the checkpoint
    lineage the *input* owns), `Emitter::commit_token` (the auto-emission chokepoint) and
    `Emitter::commit_lexer_error` (its refusal-side twin, added by this item — see below) — for
    the same reason `InputRef` never gave a callback those either.

    **The handle closed its own version of the same door.** `InputRef::emitter` — the `&mut Ctx::Emitter`
    accessor — is `pub(crate)` now, and the new forwarding methods do not even route through it:
    each reaches the emitter cell directly, the same way `emitter()` itself always did.
    `ParseState`'s equivalent accessor is deleted outright, not narrowed — nothing in the crate
    called that one at all. Both gained the same forwarding surface `EmitterView`
    exposes, under the same method names, so `inp.cst_start(k)` does everything
    `inp.emitter().cst_start(k)` used to and there is nothing left over to put in a slot.
    `InputRef::emitter_ref` (shared) is public — **new here, not retained**: 0.7.3 and every build
    before this one had only the `&mut` accessor, and `Input::emitter` has always been
    crate-private, so reading a concrete emitter's own state from a grammar is a capability this
    item *adds* while removing the mutable one. It is safe to expose for the reason the mutable
    one was not: a `&E` cannot re-enter an emitter slot, because
    every recording method the trait family declares takes `&mut self`. Four getters that used to
    hand back `&mut Ctx::Emitter` outright now hand back an `EmitterView` in the same position
    instead — `peek_with_emitter`, `peek_with_emitter_terminal`,
    `sync_through_then_peek_with_emitter` and `sync_to_then_peek_with_emitter` keep their names
    and their callers' destructuring; only a call site that named the tuple's second type, or
    tried to re-wrap the reference, breaks.

    **One thing the closed door takes with it: `Marker::complete` is no longer callable from a
    parse.** It takes `&mut E` where `E: CstEmitter`, and after this item nothing public hands a
    grammar `&mut Ctx::Emitter` — `inp.emitter()` is `pub(crate)` (`error[E0624]`) and
    `EmitterView` is not a `CstEmitter` (`error[E0277]`), both reproduced against this branch. So
    `CompletedMarker` and `CompletedMarker::precede`, whose only producer is `complete`, are out
    of a grammar's reach with it. Nothing is removed or renamed: the verb still compiles for code
    that *owns* an `E: CstEmitter` (the shipped `Fatal` / `Silent` / `Verbose` / `Ignored` all
    implement it), and a grammar's route to the same two events is `inp.cst_start_at(mark, kind)`
    + `inp.cst_finish(kind)` off the new forwarding surface, which this release also adds. What
    is lost is the single-use typestate over that pair, since the raw route cannot consume the
    marker. `Marker` is not a leak in the other direction — it consumes a `&mut E` and never
    yields one — and the type's own docs now carry both shapes and this constraint. A
    `complete`-shaped verb over the view is a 0.9 question, not a late change here.

    **`CstEmitter::cst_token` is deleted, not deprecated.** It was the caller-chosen-span,
    no-consumption door — a grammar could pick which source bytes a token-shaped event names
    without any settle having happened — and nothing in the parse machinery ever called it.
    `Emitter::commit_token`, the input layer's own auto-emission chokepoint, was always the other
    producer of token events; with `cst_token` gone it is the **only** one.

    **The same door was open on the diagnostic channel, under another name, and this item closes
    that one too — `Emitter::commit_lexer_error` is new.** A recording sink's `finish` tiles a
    source byte no committed token covers *only* where a recorded lexer error covers it; an
    unexplained byte is a dropped committed token and is refused (`FinishError::UncoveredGap`).
    So a recorded lexer-error span is not a note, it is a **licence** — and until this change
    every route to `Emitter::emit_lexer_error` minted one, including the two that hand a
    caller-chosen span to a sink with nothing consumed for it: `InputRef::emit_lexer_error` (and
    `ParseState`'s re-export) and `EmitterView::emit_lexer_error`. A parser could excuse bytes it
    had simply walked away from, and through the orphan-rule wrapper described below a **foreign**
    parse's refusals — spans in a buffer this sink never saw — excused bytes of the original
    source. That is the `cst_token` shape exactly: a span the caller picks, licensing coverage,
    with nothing consumed.

    The fix splits the report from the evidence rather than removing the capability, because a
    parser must still be able to say *"this input is malformed here"* inline, with no rewind —
    the reason the `decide` family exists at all. `Emitter::commit_lexer_error` is the input
    layer's own door, called from its single deduped reporting site and withheld from both
    forwarding surfaces beside `commit_token`; the recording sink overrides it to record the
    coverage span. `Emitter::emit_lexer_error` keeps every caller it had and stays the diagnostic:
    the report reaches the inner emitter, occupies its slot in the rewindable log, and records no
    coverage span.

    **For almost every emitter this is invisible.** `commit_lexer_error`'s default body forwards
    to `emit_lexer_error`, so an emitter that only collects diagnostics — `Fatal`, `Verbose`,
    `Silent`, `Ignored`, and essentially every emitter downstream — implements nothing, receives
    every lexer error exactly as before, and cannot tell the doors apart. Two shapes must act.
    A **wrapper** emitter forwards `commit_lexer_error` the way it forwards `commit_token`;
    inheriting the default delivers the layer's refusals to the wrapped emitter as caller reports,
    and a wrapped recording sink then refuses a region that was legitimately unlexable. An emitter
    that *records* lexer-error spans as structural evidence overrides it. `LEXER_ERROR_CENSUS`
    (`src/input/input_ref/census_tests.rs`) and `COVERAGE_EVIDENCE_CENSUS`
    (`src/cst/sink/tests.rs`) lock the producer at one site and keep the method off the view.

    **What this does not close.** `EmitterView` implements no emitter trait *in this crate*,
    which is a fact about this crate, not a proof that no such implementation can exist: under
    the orphan rules a downstream crate whose own lexer type appears in the parameter list may
    write `impl Emitter for EmitterView<'_, '_, ItsLexer, Sink<…>>` and install that over a
    foreign buffer from inside a callback. It compiles, and it was run. What such a wrapper cannot
    reach is **either** producer of the sink's coverage machinery: `commit_token`, which is what
    pairs a span with a byte, and `commit_lexer_error`, which is what licenses a byte to have no
    token — neither is on the view's surface. Measured end to end: a foreign parse driven that way
    injects a node through the forwarded `cst_start`/`cst_finish` and reports its diagnostics into
    the log, while the sink still materializes its own text over its own coverage — no token, no
    span, no byte and no *licence* of the foreign buffer crosses. Stating that bound in terms of
    `commit_token` alone was incomplete through the release candidates, and the foreign-licence
    route it missed is now pinned from outside the crate by
    `an_orphan_view_wrapper_carries_a_foreign_lexer_error_but_licenses_no_gap`
    (`tests/parser_node.rs`), which returned a plausible round-tripping tree before the split and
    an `UncoveredGap` after it. The wrong-*text* class this item exists to close has no route
    through it; the node and diagnostic channels it reaches are ones a `decide` body could already
    reach directly, in its own parse, by design.

    **`Emitter::bound_source`, `Source::REFERENT_IS_BYTES` and `SourceIdentity` are retained, not
    retired**, and the known limitation below is corrected in place rather than left standing on
    a promise this item breaks — see it for the reasoning: the handshake is what a wrapper on the
    orphan route above has to forward honestly for the general constructor check to still catch a
    foreign pairing.

    **Migration.** A `decide`/`peek_then`/pratt-fold callback's emitter parameter changes type; a
    body that only calls methods by name does not otherwise change, because the replacement type
    is derivable from the function's own `Peeked<…>` parameter and `where` clause. Measured on
    the reference consumer: **43 one-line signature changes across 20 files, zero body changes,
    zero call-site changes.** A CST parse moves from `Sink::new` + `finish` to `parse_lossless` +
    the `Cst` handle's `finish`; a context pair now holds the sink **by value** rather than by
    `&mut`, so a `'sink` lifetime parameter disappears from any consumer type alias that named
    one.

    ```rust
    // before
    let sink = Sink::new(source, emitter, CstProfile::new(map_kind, ERROR, GAP));
    // (sink installed as the input's context, driven by the grammar — omitted)
    let (green, emitter) = sink.finish(ROOT);

    // after
    let (cst, parsed) = parse_lossless(source, state, emitter, profile, cache, grammar);
    let (green, emitter) = cst.finish(ROOT);
    ```

    **Performance: no regression.** Eight benchmark ids, three interleaved A/B rounds pooled
    against an archived baseline: a noise floor of 0.66–1.65% per id, and the largest excursion
    from it is **−0.912%** — inside its own floor, on every id. A regression below ~1% would not
    have been visible on this machine, so the honest reading is a null result, not a measured
    improvement. An attribution check backs it: a callback-cost regression from the new
    indirection would have moved the ids where the driver's own dispatch is ~30% of self time
    together and away from the ids where it is ~10%, and it did not — both groups moved with the
    noise, not against each other. Machine load 1.77–4.69 throughout.

### Debug and rendered output

Every `Debug` / `Display` movement in this release, in one place, because a consumer who
freezes renders needs one list rather than a reading of the whole changelog. This subsection
exists because a private-field `Debug` delta broke a real consumer's frozen parity renders
during this campaign and cost a bisect — and because the *earliest* of these shipped four
rounds ago and was disclosed nowhere until now.

**Mechanism is stated per row, because it decides who has to review the next field
addition.** A *derived* `Debug` moves by itself the moment a field is added; a *hand-written*
one is a maintained surface that a field addition silently leaves stale unless someone edits
it. Both are listed, and which is which is not guesswork here — it was measured, and it is not
what an earlier inventory of this release assumed.

| Type | What moved | Mechanism | Round |
|---|---|---|---|
| `UnexpectedEnd` | gained a private `terminal: bool`, so `{:?}` renders it and `Eq` / `Hash` account for it — two errors differing only in terminal status stop comparing equal | **derived** | R1, #111 |
| `Unclosed` | gained the `kind` field | **derived** | #121 |
| `MissingToken` | gained the `name` channel; `Eq` / `Hash` derive over it | `Debug` is **hand-written** (`debug_fmt`), and already names the field | R4, #114 |
| `SeparatedError` | gained the `name` channel; `Eq` / `Hash` derive over it | `Debug` is **hand-written**, and already names the field | R4, #114 |
| `FinishError` | gained `InvalidDiagnosticSpan`, `MismatchedFinish`, `NonUtf8Source`, `InvalidDialectKind` | derived | R8, #123 |
| `CstProfile`, `KindValidator` | new types; `Debug` deliberately does **not** render the fn pointer (its derived form is a code address) | hand-written | R8, #123 |
| `PartialSession`, `Budget`, `SessionRefusal` | new types | `PartialSession` hand-written (pinned field list); the other two derived | R8, #123 |
| `MissingToken`, `UnexpectedToken` | `Display` drops the doubled word: `…, expected expected '}'` becomes `…, expected '}'` | rendering change, both carriers | R10 |
| `SeparatedError` | gained a `Display` it never had | new rendered surface | R10 |
| `RecursionLimitReached`, `NonAssociativeChain` | new types, so nothing frozen moves; listed because both are carriers a consumer will render — `Debug` derived, `Display` from `thiserror`. Each render names its offset the way the type's accessor does, not as a construct's location: `recursion limit reached at 15: depth 9, maximum 8` (committed consumption at the frame that could not be entered) and `non-associative operator cannot be chained at its own power; input handed back at 5, at or before the operator` (the handback of item 44 — on `1 ; 2 ; 3` the repeated operator starts at 6, and the render deliberately does not claim to name it). Both strings, and both derived `Debug`s, are pinned in `tests/render_freeze.rs` | derived | R12 |

**New panic messages.** A consumer that captures panic payloads — a test harness, a supervisor
loop, a `catch_unwind` host — sees new observable strings even though no `Debug` or `Display`
impl moved:

- `"end must be greater than or equal to start"` and `"start must be less than or equal to end"`
  on six `SimpleSpan` const mutators and on `<SimpleSpan<O> as Span>::bump`;
- `"span bump overflows usize"` on three const mutators and on `<Range<usize> as Span>::bump`;
- `"choice id {id} out of bounds for {len} branches"`, replacing the raw slice-index message;
- `"checkpoint id space exhausted"` / `"savepoint sequence exhausted"` /
  `"cache-push counter exhausted"` on the input's witness counters;
- the two source-identity refusals at the parse entry — a different source value, and a bound
  extent shorter than the parse reads.

**Of these, only the span messages are reachable from a program that runs today**, and that is
the point of them: they replace a silently corrupt span with a panic that names where it went
wrong. The rest fire only on misuse, on exhaustion of a 2^64 id space, or — for the
source-identity refusals — only where an unequal reference *proves* an unequal source, or where
the emitter is bound to a strictly shorter slice of that source than the parse reads. Neither is
something a correct program produces: the second refuses only the direction that can smuggle
structure, and leaves the longer-bound streaming direction alone.

### Added

New public items that arrived *as part of* a breaking change are described in full at the
item that carries them, and listed here only so scanning this section does not miss them:
`error::MaybeTerminal` (item 16), `ValueKeyedEmitter` (item 18), `SessionPointId` (item 19),
`MissingToken`/`SeparatedError`'s `with_name` and `name` (item 20), `PrattFloor` (item 23),
`DelimiterKind` and `Delimiter::KIND` (item 28), `SeparatorHandler::OBSERVES_SEPARATORS`
(item 5), `CstProfile` and `KindValidator` (item 13), `error::NonAssociativeChain` (item 41),
`error::RecursionLimitReached` with `input::Descent`, `InputRef::descending`,
`InputRef::descend`, `InputRef::recursion`, `RecursionLimiter::unlimited`,
`InputContext::with_recursion_limiter` and `ParserContext::with_recursion_limiter` (item 42),
`cst::parse_lossless`, `cst::parse_lossless_partial` and `cst::Cst` (item 68), `EmitterView`
(item 68). **`FromPrattError` is not on this list**:
item 46's two new obligations are `From` impls on your own error type, and the trait gains no
member, so a hand-written `FromPrattError` impl compiles unchanged.

- **The logos adapter works on 0.14 and 0.15, and is tested there.** `logos_0_14` /
  `logos_0_15` / `logos_0_16` were already separate features, but `tokora::logos` (and its
  `__private` twin) re-exported 0.16 only, and every one of the 79 integration test files was
  gated on the plain `logos` feature — which *implies* 0.16. The consequence was that the
  per-version CI legs compiled a crate whose adapter integration tests were all invisible to
  them: not one test they ran exercised a logos adapter.

  Both aliases now follow the same newest-wins precedence chain the adapter re-exports use
  (0.16 > 0.15 > 0.14), and the 118 `feature = "logos"` gates across 99 files became the
  three-version disjunction. `--features logos` still means exactly what it meant — the
  feature still enables 0.16 — so no existing consumer changes.

  Measured: the versioned legs now run the adapter integration tests at 0.14 and 0.15, all passing.
  Exactly one source construct was version-divergent across the whole surface — logos 0.16's
  `allow_greedy` nested attribute in one test fixture — and it is now a per-version
  `cfg_attr` split rather than a 0.16-only file.
  — *(R11)*

- **Oracle pins for the checkpoint capture window.** Taking a checkpoint (`save`, and so
  `begin`, `attempt` and session points) registers two things a later settle must find — a
  lineage entry and an emitter mark — and a `Checkpoint` has no `Drop` to settle them with, so
  an unwind between the first registration and the finished value would strand it where nothing
  could ever find it. The capture has run every fallible step ahead of both registrations since
  that was fixed, and nothing pinned it from the outside.

  Three tests now do, one per kind of caller code the window runs: a panicking `L::Span::clone`,
  a panicking `L::State::clone`, and a **foreign `Emitter::checkpoint` that panics**. Each
  asserts that the armed payload actually fired *and* that the world across the caught unwind is
  the world before it — live checkpoints, pins, emitter marks, cursor, span, recorded
  diagnostics. These are additive pins, not fixes: they were red before the reordering and are
  green now, and their red was demonstrated by mutating the capture order rather than claimed.
  The emitter cell is deliberately a law boundary — it asserts tokora's half only, because a
  mark the emitter never handed back is the emitter's to reconcile.
  — *(R11)*

- **Streaming sessions.** `PartialSession`, `Budget`, `SessionRefusal`, `RedriveFromBase` and
  the sealed `ReplayMode` give `parse_partial` a lifecycle: a partial parse survives its
  refills instead of restarting, under a budget that a caller sets and can observe. See the
  known limitation below before pairing a session with a recording `Sink`.
  — *(R8, #123)*

- **`CstText`** — the source-to-`&str` bridge, so a byte-like source materializes a tree when
  it is valid UTF-8 and returns `FinishError::NonUtf8Source` with the offending offset when it
  is not, rather than being unusable.
  — *(R8, #123)*

- **`SeparatedError` gains `Display`.** The D30 separator-name channel was readable only by
  destructuring through `into_components`, so a diagnostic that knew *which* separator was
  involved had no way to say so — half the channel's user-visible point had nothing to render
  through. It is born under the composition rule below, with a single "expected".
  — *(R10)*

- **`BStr` joins the `Equivalent` family.** `utils::cmp`'s module documentation listed `BStr`
  among its backings while the impls were absent from **both** files the family spans, so
  `S: Equivalent<str>` refused `&BStr` with a bare `E0277`. The `Equivalent<str>` /
  `Equivalent<[u8]>` / `Equivalent<BStr>` triple and the `ToEquivalent`/`IntoEquivalent` half
  now exist, gated on `bstr_1` like the `Source` impls.

  The two files are deliberately **not** collapsed into one macro this round: the compile-time
  assert lattice is the anti-drift mechanism, and its rows fail to compile if either half of a
  backing goes missing. That is teeth by construction, where a macro would be organisation-only
  churn.
  — *(R10)*

- **`PolicyComposableEmitter` and `PolicyParseContext`** — a second bundle tier, for the count
  and separator **policy** builders. `ComposableEmitter` covers the collecting combinators at
  their default policy; `at_most` / `bounded` additionally need `TooManyEmitter`, and
  `require_leading` / `require_trailing` need the missing-separator pair. Before this there was
  no bundle carrying those, so a production using a policy builder fell back to spelling the
  ladder — the exact restatement a bundle exists to remove, reappearing one tier up.

  Two tiers rather than one widened bundle, deliberately: widening would make every consumer's
  *concrete instantiation* demand `From<TooMany>` and `From<MissingToken>` on its error type —
  for `Fatal` and `Verbose`, whose impls carry those bounds — whether or not a policy builder
  is ever used. Bundle-1 is a supertrait of bundle-2, so the lattice is strict and each tier is
  true to its own documentation. Pratt is outside both and names its own emitter.

  Additive: bundle-1 is untouched, so nothing migrates. **The re-scoped documentation is the
  other half of the fix** — `ComposableEmitter`'s and `ComposableParseContext`'s docs, and the
  three guide chapters that repeated the claim, said they covered a surface they did not.
  — *(R10)*

- **`Silent`'s `PrattEmitter` impl loses four bounds it never used.** It demanded
  `FromEmitterError` plus `From<UnexpectedEoLhs>` and `From<UnexpectedEoRhs>` on the error type
  while both bodies discard their payloads, which made `Silent` representation-dependent where
  its three siblings are not — `Ignored`'s twin has carried no bounds all along. Removing impl
  bounds only widens the set of admissible types, so nothing migrates; a `Silent<E>` whose `E`
  implements no conversions now drives the token pratt driver. The typed driver's own
  `From<UnexpectedEoLhs/EoRhs>` obligations are unaffected — those are stated at its call
  sites, and `Fatal` and `Verbose` keep their bounds because their bodies use the conversions.
  — *(R10)*

- **`CstProfile` and `KindValidator` no longer require the `rowan` feature.** Both are
  fn-pointer and data only, with no rowan dependence at all, so the gate was placement rather
  than design. It mattered because a `macro_rules!` expansion cannot cfg on tokora's features:
  a macro whose validator arm names `KindValidator` was forcing `rowan` onto every consumer of
  the macro, including those who never build a tree. Strictly more configurations compile; the
  sink half keeps its gate.
  — *(R10)*

- **A CST `Sink` implements `UnclosedEmitter`.** It was the one capability trait the sink did
  not serve, and the omission was not cosmetic: `UnclosedEmitter` is a member of
  `ComposableEmitter`, so a `Sink` could not satisfy the one-bound collecting surface at all —
  a delimited CST parse could not name the bundle its diagnostics-only sibling names. The
  forwarding census could not see it either, because it hard-coded a capability list with the
  same gap; the two omissions hid each other. The census now asserts the membership at the type
  level instead of by string matching.
  — *(R10)*

- **A parse and its emitter can share a source identity.** `Emitter::bound_source` (defaulted
  `None`, so nothing migrates) lets an emitter declare the source it binds; the point at which
  an emitter is attached to an input compares that against the source the parse reads and
  refuses a **provable** mismatch. `Source::REFERENT_IS_BYTES` (defaulted `false`) is how a
  backing says whether an unequal reference proves anything — `true` only for the `?Sized`
  backings, where the reference *is* the data.

  `SourceIdentity` carries **two** things, because there are two failures and they are not
  symmetric. `addr()` is the offset origin, and it is an equality: `&buf[..2]` and `&buf[..3]`
  share one, `&buf[1..]` does not. `extent()` is the byte length, and it is an *ordering* —
  `covers()` is the named relation, and it requires the emitter's extent to be **at least** the
  parse's:

  - a sink bound to a **shorter** slice than the parse reads is refused. It needs no
    out-of-bounds span to do harm: a parser can peek past the sink's end, commit nothing there,
    and let those bytes choose the tree's shape. The result materializes with no
    `SpanOutOfBounds` and no `UncoveredGap`, and round-trips against the sink's own buffer — so
    nothing downstream can see that the structure came from bytes the text does not contain.
  - a sink bound to a **longer** slice is the fixed-arena streaming shape and is accepted. Every
    span the parse emits lies inside the sink's extent, so every slice is correct; the unparsed
    tail is `finish`'s question, answered as `UncoveredGap` or tiled by `finish_partial`.

  See the known limitation below for what this closes and what it leaves.
  — *(R10)*

- **`conformance::emitter`** — the two-assertion kit for an emitter that binds a source:
  `assert_binds_source` catches the author who inherited `bound_source`'s default while
  actually binding one, and `assert_forwards_bound_source` catches a wrapper that forwards
  every emission but not this one. Both failure modes are silent otherwise, and neither is
  detectable from inside tokora.
  — *(R10)*

- **`conformance::cache`** — the cache contract as a runnable kit rather than prose.
  `CacheHarness` drives an implementation through the rollback, put-back and lookahead laws
  the trait states, so a third-party `Cache` can be checked against them instead of
  inferred to comply.
  — *(R9)*

- **`Dialect`** — a two-item anchor (`Lang`, `Lexer`) with the projection aliases `LexerOf`,
  `LangOf`, `DialectSlice`, `DialectInput` and `DialectErrorOf`. Everything else a production
  needs — source, slice, token, span, offset, token capabilities — is reachable by projection,
  so pin those in a one-line subtrait rather than as further associated items.

  There is deliberately no `DialectCtx`. A context bound written through `LangOf<'inp, D>`
  does not unify with one written at the brand: the param-env predicate stays at the
  projection while the obligation normalises. This is documented at the type with the
  mechanism and the verbatim failure, so the shape is not rediscovered by trial.
  — *(W-api-A, #118)*

- **`#[diagnostic::on_unimplemented]` on `FromTokenErrors`, `FromUnclosed` and `Dialect`.**
  A missing conversion now reports what is missing and carries a copyable impl skeleton,
  rather than surfacing as a nested obligation inside crate internals.

  Note for consumers: rustc attaches the *root* obligation's attribute. A bound reached
  through your own blanket-implemented subtrait reports that subtrait, not ours — annotate
  your own dialect traits if you want curated text there.
  — *(W-api-A, #118)*

- **`InputRef::is_exhausted()`** — the consumer-exhaustion predicate: no lexed token is waiting and
  the lexer frontier has reached the end of the buffer. This is the correct gate for a driver loop,
  where `is_eoi()` is not: `is_eoi` answers `true` the moment any lookahead lexes through the end,
  while the tokens that lookahead produced are still unconsumed. `is_exhausted()` is independent of
  the cache implementation.
  — *(R5, #116)*

- **`Cache::RETAINS_FRONT`** — a new trait constant declaring that a front push into an **empty**
  cache always succeeds, i.e. the cache can retain at least one token. It defaults to `false`, so
  the addition is semver-compatible and an existing implementation keeps working unchanged. A cache
  that declares `true` lets the input layer prove its parked-front slot statically unreachable, so
  every probe of it folds away at monomorphization; the shipped caches declare it accordingly
  (`Option` `true`, `ArrayDeque<_, N>` `N != 0`, the black holes `false`). A cache that
  declares `true` and then refuses a front push into an empty cache is violating the contract, and
  now panics at the refusal rather than losing the token.
  — *(R5, #116)*

- **Match-first token dispatch.** `select!` / `try_select!` and their runtime,
  `tokora::parser::dispatch_take` / `try_dispatch_take`. One arm per kind, the kind table
  written once beside the patterns, the head classified once against the whole table, and
  each arm receiving the **moved** payload — replacing one annotated closure per kind plus a
  dead re-match, and the hand-written `unreachable!()` for "the kind matched but the variant
  did not" (the runtime turns that into a typed error carrying the table). Both runtimes are
  generic over completeness, so streaming (`Partial`) parsers can use them; the context must
  be a `ComposableParseContext`. The kind expressions must be **const-promotable** — a
  non-promotable one is `E0716` pointing at the invocation rather than the arm; the macro's
  own docs say so and name the fix.
  — *(W-api-B)*

- **Head observation that does not fold a halt into absence.** `InputRef::peek_head_map`,
  `head_satisfies` and `peek_kind`. `peek_one` answers `Ok(None)` for genuine end of input
  **and** for a resource-limit trip or a latched poison boundary, so a production that
  decides on the answer reads a halt as a grammar fact. The new family reserves `Ok(None)`
  for the real end of input and raises the terminal end-of-input error otherwise — marked
  terminal **when your emitter accepts the trip's diagnostic**. A *rejecting* emitter's `Err`
  is built from your lexer's error value and propagates from the fill unmarked, so recovery
  can still spend that trip — `MaybeTerminal`'s doc has that path and the arm it needs.
  `peek_one` is unchanged and is not deprecated.
  — *(W-api-B)*

- **Classify-then-take.** `InputRef::try_expect_take` / `try_expect_take_or_stop`: one
  classification by reference, the commit, then the token **by value** into a projection.
  `try_expect_map` projects by reference, so payloads cannot move out of it.
  — *(W-api-B)*

- **Three-way speculation and an imperative span bracket.** `InputRef::attempt_parse`
  (`Accept` commits, `Decline` rolls back with no fabricated error, `Err` rolls back and
  propagates) and `InputRef::spanning`.
  — *(W-api-B)*

- **Width-1 decisions without a window.** `while_head`, `while_kind` (and their types
  `WhileHead` / `WhileKind`) plus `ParseInput::peek_then_head`. The adapters are `Decision`
  impls pinned at `W = U1`, which is what removes the `::<_, U1>` turbofish, the `Peeked`
  window and the `Ctx` parameter from a hook's signature.
  — *(W-api-B)*

- **Output pinning.** `pinned::<O2, _>(parser)` and `Pinned<P, O>`, for a receiver with
  several output impls (`Collect`, `With`, `FailWith`, `Accepted`) that is ambiguous at
  every downstream site not naming the output. `Pinned`'s phantom is `fn() -> O`, so
  pinning does not move `O`'s auto-traits onto the parser and stays covariant in `O`.
  A fluent `.outputs::<O2>()` method was built and then **removed before release**: it had
  to be a blanket trait method, which plants a candidate on every `Sized` type, and a
  by-value candidate is picked before a consumer's same-named `&self` method. That was
  accepted while it was believed such a collision must be loud; a turbofish with a
  discarded return makes it silent, and an extension method whose job is to pin a type has
  no inferred spelling, so the silent path is its default. A free function resolves by path
  and can shadow nothing. The fluent form stays purely additive later.
  — *(W-api-B)*

- **Three-way ergonomics.** `ParseAttempt::into_option` (the existing `From` conversion, with
  a name that can be found) and `attempt!` — `?` for the three-way vocabulary, early-returning
  `Ok(ParseAttempt::Decline)`.
  — *(W-api-B)*

- **Exclusion parsing.** `Ident::try_parse_except` / `Ident::parse_except`: "a Name, but not
  `on`". The exclusion runs inside the classify predicate, so a decline consumes nothing.
  — *(W-api-B)*

- **Fluent parity** for the free functions most reached for: `ParseInput::{labelled, traced,
  list_until, separated1_by}` and `TryParseInput::opt`. `list_until` and `separated1_by`
  inherit the `Complete` pin of the free `list` / `separated1` they delegate to; that is
  stated on each, with the contrast against `select!`.
  — *(W-api-B)*

- **A declared CST kind space.** `syntax_kinds!` and the module `tokora::cst::kinds`. A
  dialect hand-keeps three things that must agree — the `#[repr(u16)]` enum, the
  declaration-order array its consumers index, and the predicate it hands to `CstProfile` —
  and a disagreement between them is the one shape the sink's own enforcement cannot see,
  because it only ever sees one side. The macro generates all three, plus a checked
  `from_raw`. No feature gate: it names `KindValidator`, which this release un-gates from
  `rowan`, so a `no_std` consumer that cannot enable `rowan` can still declare its kind space
  — verified from a `no_std`, no-`alloc`, no-`rowan` consumer crate on both stable and the
  1.87 MSRV.
  — *(W-api-B)*

- **Emitter diagnostics.** Eight `#[diagnostic::on_unimplemented]` messages across `Emitter`,
  `ComposableEmitter` and the six members between them, so a type short of the bundle is told
  which member is missing rather than getting rustc's default trait-bound phrasing.
  — *(W-api-B)*

66. **`cast::token_any` and `cast::tokens` close the two gaps in the cast module's token
   helpers.** `token` answers one kind, first match, and that was the whole vocabulary: a node
   whose grammar puts more than one token kind in the same slot, or repeats one token kind under
   a parent that gives it no node kind of its own, had nothing to reach for and had to hand-roll
   the same `children_with_tokens` filter at the call site.

   `token_any` is the first direct token child whose kind is one of several, scanned in
   **document order, not `kinds` order**: trying `kinds[0]` and falling back to `kinds[1]` would
   answer the wrong token for a node carrying both, which is a difference no caller should have
   to know about. `tokens` is every direct token child of one kind, in document order, returned
   through the new `cast::TokenChildren` iterator — `cast::children`'s `NodeChildren` is an
   alias for an upstream rowan type, and rowan has no ready-made iterator over one token kind,
   so this crate now provides one.

   Both are generic over `Language` and take their kind(s) by reference, matching `token`'s own
   shape; `token_any` takes `&[L::Kind]` rather than a predicate closure because callers pass a
   fixed, short, statically-known set of alternatives, not an open-ended rule. Both also see
   only *direct* token children, exactly like `token`: a token belonging to a child node is that
   node's, and neither helper reaches into it — covered alongside the document-order and
   empty/no-match cases in `cst::cast`'s test suite.

### Fixed

- **An `Input` is bound to exactly one emitter, at construction, for its whole life.** The input
  stores two **suppression** watermarks whose meaning is relative to *one emitter's log* —
  `emitted_error_end` (lexer-error dedup, shipped) and `front_reported_end` (close-miss
  suppression, added this release) — while `Input::as_ref` took the emitter as a **parameter**,
  so which log a watermark described was chosen per borrow. A watermark carried into a different
  log claims a report that log never received, and because these watermarks suppress, the
  consequence is a **silently dropped diagnostic**, not a duplicated one.

  It was latent: no in-crate path paired one input with two emitters, and `Input` is
  `pub(crate)` and unexported, so no external path existed. That is a property of in-crate
  discipline, though, not of the type system — which is what this replaces. `Input` now owns an
  `emitter: Ctx::Emitter`; `with_state_and_cache` becomes `with_state_and_context`, taking
  exactly the `InputContext` that `ParseContext::provide` already returns; and `as_ref` loses its
  emitter argument. The per-borrow choice is not merely unexercised, it is **unconstructable**.

  Three consequences worth naming. The **source-identity handshake** moves into the constructor,
  which is where the pair now forms — so it runs once per input rather than once per handle, and
  covers every borrow by construction. `impl Clone for Input` is **deleted**: a clone would have
  had to duplicate an emission log, which is not a thing a log can be. And the `{emitter mark,
  emitted_error_end, front_reported_end, poison_boundary}` group that `Checkpoint` has always
  saved and restored as a unit is now a unit in the *live* structure too — before, two of the
  four were facts about a log the input did not hold.

  **The `as_ref` call-site census from #127 is deleted in the same change**, and the reason is
  the point: that rail guarded the claim *"no in-crate path pairs one `Input` with two different
  emitters"* during the window when the claim needed guarding. There is no longer an emitter
  argument for a new call site to mispair, so the claim is unconstructable rather than merely
  unviolated, and the rail has nothing left that could fail. A rail whose property becomes
  structural dies with the property rather than lingering as a check that can no longer check —
  the *check that stops being a check* class this campaign catalogued. Its replacement is the
  type system. One cell arrives in its place, `dedup_watermark_survives_a_reborrow_of_one_input`,
  which pins the only shape still *writable*: a watermark raised in one handle still suppresses
  the next handle's re-lex of the same region. That cell is also what forecloses the cheaper
  remedy the issue weighed — clearing every log-dependent watermark on borrow — from being
  reintroduced later as a tidy-up, since under it the cell reports twice.

  No public item changes signature: `Input` is `pub(crate)`, and `InputRef` — which *is*
  re-exported, from both the crate root and the prelude — is untouched, as are `Session`,
  `Checkpoint`, the scan paths, transactions and session points.
  — *(R11, #128)*

- **The documentation builds at every feature point.** `cargo doc --no-default-features` had
  never been run: it exited 101 with `error: could not document tokora` and **39 unresolved
  intra-doc links** across 15 files. The crate denies `rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links` via
  `[lints] workspace = true`, so this was a hard error rather than a warning — but the only
  doc job built `--all-features`, where every gated target exists and therefore every link
  resolves. The blind spot was structural: an all-features doc build cannot see this class.

  Each affected link now carries a per-configuration pair — the gated arm is byte-identical
  to what shipped, the ungated arm renders the same sentence with the unavailable item as
  plain code text rather than a dead link. The targets are all gated `any(std, alloc)`
  (`Verbose` and its family, `StackedTransaction`, the session-point and stacked-transaction
  entry points, `foldrn`, `separated1`), so both configurations render clean prose. No
  crate- or module-level `allow` was added: an exemption whose subject is "all broken links
  here" would silently absorb the next genuinely broken one.
  — *(R11)*

- **Documented what the dispatch tables actually do on a malformed table.** `DispatchOnKind`
  and `FusedDispatchOnKind` resolve duplicate kinds **first-wins** (the lookup stops at the
  first match, so a later duplicate is dead), and an oversized table is checked only by a
  `debug_assert!` — in release, an entry past the branch range can never select a branch and a
  kind found only there classifies as a dispatch miss. Neither is rejected at construction,
  deliberately: refusing at build time would turn a misuse into a behaviour change. Nothing
  moved; the docs now say what the code does. The non-fused constructor also gained the fused
  twin's "or a latched limit boundary" parenthetical on its end-of-input row.
  — *(R11)*

- **Documented the token-level Pratt driver's recovery posture.** When a prefix operator's
  operand never arrives, the driver reports the diagnostic and then returns **the operator
  token itself** as the expression; an infix operator missing its right operand yields the LHS
  alone. Under a recording emitter the parse continues carrying that stand-in. The token driver
  has no node to withhold, so this is deliberate — callers wanting the stricter posture use the
  typed driver — but it was written down nowhere and had no cell. Both exits are now documented
  and the prefix exit is pinned.
  — *(R11)*

- **Corrected where `finish_partial` places a trailing gap.** The tiling comment said the tail
  tiles "into the root". Measured: the tail is tiled **before** the open frames are closed, so
  when the stream ends with a node still open the gap becomes a child of the **innermost open
  node**. Under `finish` the question cannot arise — an unbalanced stream is refused — so the
  old sentence was true only for the case `finish_partial` exists to relax. `tree.text() ==
  source` holds either way; it is the placement that differs, and tooling that walks by node
  rather than by text can see it. Behaviour unchanged; the construct now has its first
  placement pin, which is why the sentence was unverifiable for as long as it was.
  — *(R11)*

- **The CAS-less `no_std` source-backend rows say what they require.** Four rows in the feature
  reference read "as the dep allows". `bytes`, `hipstr` and `smol_bytes` reach a refcounted
  buffer through `Arc`-shaped sharing and need atomic compare-and-swap, so they cannot build on
  a target like `thumbv6m-none-eabi`; `bstr` is the CAS-free choice and is pinned by a CI cell
  on that exact target. The CAS-needing three are documented rather than pinned as
  expected-failures, since an expected-failure cell would go green for the wrong reason the day
  an upstream crate gained a CAS-free fallback.
  — *(R11)*

- **A session's budget guard now holds in release builds.** `PartialSession` refuses an
  attempt that would exceed its budget or that follows a terminal latch, and it relies on the
  downstream `From<SessionRefusal>` conversion preserving terminal status. That requirement
  was enforced by a `debug_assert!`, so a **release** build could surface `BudgetExhausted` or
  `TerminalLatched` as an error whose `is_incomplete()` returned true — and a caller would
  then refill and retry forever against a session that refuses before doing any work. A
  zero-work infinite refill loop is precisely the denial-of-service shape the budget exists to
  prevent, and it was absent from the builds that matter. The check is now unconditional.

  **Behaviour change:** a `From<SessionRefusal>` implementation that drops terminal status now
  fails in release as it always did in debug. The cost is one `is_terminal()` call per
  *refused* attempt — never on the success path, and nothing per token or per event.
  — *(R8, #123)*

- The `cache` module no longer advertises a dynamic, allocator-backed cache with unlimited
  lookahead. No such implementation exists, `alloc` does not add one, and none could serve a
  public peek past 32 tokens — `Window` is sealed at U1–U32. Lookahead beyond the window is
  what transactions are for.
  — *(R9)*

- **A regime change could silently corrupt lexer-error deduplication.** `set_state` and
  `state_mut` share a body that cleared the cache, dropped the parked token and
  cleared the poison boundary, **then** cloned an offset, **then** re-anchored the dedup watermark.
  `Offset::clone` is caller code. A panic there left the watermark holding the **dead regime's**
  value on an input that had just been unpoisoned — so for the rest of the parse, lexer-error
  dedup compared new-regime spans against a stale mark and **silently suppressed or duplicated
  diagnostics**.

  The read is now hoisted above every mutation and takes the span's end directly, which is provably
  the same value: the cursor reports the parked token, else the cache front, else the span — and the
  two clears exist precisely to empty the first two, so the fallback branch was the one that ran
  either way. The old "cleared before the cursor read" ordering was documenting a coupling that
  existed only to steer the cursor into that branch.
  — *(R9)*

- **A checkpoint rollback is all-or-nothing.** `restore_unchecked` interleaved caller code with
  the facts it was installing: cache eviction,
  session-point abandonment and a span clamp all ran between the lineage pop and the position
  restore. A panic in any of them left the input **half-rolled-back** — lineage, cache and emitter
  on the checkpoint's branch while the position and the remaining facts stayed on the abandoned one.

  The body is now two phases. **Phase 1 runs every operation that can execute caller code, while
  the input is still wholly on the branch being abandoned** — so a panic there leaves it there,
  which is the *unchanged* half of all-or-nothing. **Phase 2 installs every fact with no caller
  code among them.** (Staging the evicted values to a single drop site was the obvious repair and
  is not available: checkpoints work in allocator-less builds, so there is nowhere to put an
  unbounded number of evicted entries. The ordering achieves the same guarantee without one.)

  **The residue, stated precisely:** a rollback is atomic unless a **cached token's, or an abandoned
  session point's, own `Span`/`State` drop panics** — unreachable for every type this crate ships,
  since they are `Copy`. Such a panic leaves the input on the branch it was already on, with part of
  a cache that would have been discarded anyway.
  — *(R9)*

- **An interrupted restore can no longer make an abandoned scan's diagnostics permanent.**
  `restore_entry` restored the input's position and facts and **then** cloned a cursor to hand
  `Emitter::rewind`. `Offset::clone` is caller code, so a panic there left the input restored with
  the emitter mark **not rewound** — and the scan scope's fallback then *released* that mark, making
  an abandoned scan's diagnostics and token-observer effects permanent while the parser retried from
  the restored position.

  **Hoisting the clone within the body does not fix this**, which is worth stating because it is the
  obvious repair: wherever in `restore_entry` the clone sits, failing it still skips the rewind. The
  operation had to leave the body entirely. The scan's entry record now carries the rewind cursor,
  cloned at capture — **before the mark exists** — so `restore_entry` performs no caller operations
  at all.

  The same round removed three further in-place field writes on the restore paths where a panic
  would have left the input and the checkpoint disagreeing about the dedup watermark and the poison
  latch.

  — *(R9)*

- **A token left unconsumed by a `to`-shaped scan stop or by a `try_expect*` / `probe_close`
  decline is now retained even when the configured `Cache` refuses it**, so the cursor, offset,
  `is_eoi`, the `sync_balanced` hole anchor and the lexer-state tally after such a stop are the
  same under every cache capacity — including a zero-capacity `()`, where the token used to be
  dropped and re-lexed by the next call. `ClosePayload::CacheFront` is renamed
  `ClosePayload::AtFront` (crate-internal).
  — *(R5, #116)*

- **`InputRef::lexer()` now resumes under the state that produced the newest retained token**
  rather than under the committed state, so a widening lookahead no longer lexes the token after
  a retained run as if that run had never been scanned. A by-value `Lexer::State` limiter is no
  longer bypassed by the lookahead pattern, and the tokens a drain yields, the final state and
  the diagnostics it emits no longer depend on how deep — or in how many steps — the caller
  peeked first.
  — *(R5, #116)*

- **A non-final EOF now reports the lexer's own end offset** instead of the end of the last item
  it yielded, so bytes the lexer skipped before exhaustion (trailing whitespace, a comment tail)
  are no longer omitted from the `Incomplete` frontier a refill driver reads. The reported offset
  is floored by what was already lexed and clamped to the buffer.
  — *(R5, #116)*

- **`InputRef::foldr_within` no longer drops a run shorter than its window.** The exhaustion
  arm returned the untouched initializer *after* consuming the run into the fold's buffer, so
  every run of length `1 ..= W::CAPACITY - 1` was silently discarded on the `Ok` path. Both
  exits now converge on the single reverse drain, as the sibling `foldrn` already did.
  — *(R7, #117)*

- **A render-freeze suite.** One pinned `Debug` and `Display` string per public error type
  (`tests/render_freeze.rs`). Rendered text is public API that no signature describes and no
  tool reads: `cargo semver-checks` compares shapes, and a derived `Debug` that gains a field
  has the shape it always had. That gap cost this crate twice — `UnexpectedEnd`'s undisclosed
  `terminal` field, and a doubled "expected" that survived in the one carrier nobody had
  pinned. A failure here does not mean something broke; it means a rendered surface moved and
  has to be disclosed, and blessing it is a reviewed diff of the exact bytes a consumer's
  frozen fixtures will see.
  — *(R10)*

- **The `no_std` tiers now execute in CI, and the first run of that cell was red.**
  `cargo build --no-default-features` gated a production-code violation but never compiled a
  test target, so nothing `no_std`-shaped had ever *run* — a whole test suite in a configuration
  that executed none of it. Enabling it immediately found a dead-code failure (`scan_tick` has no call
  site without an allocator, since its callers are allocator-gated) that predates this round
  and that no gate could see. Fixed, and the two host runs plus D46b's positive
  `thumbv6m` + `bstr` cell are now CI steps.
  — *(R10)*

- **The input's three monotone witness counters are checked, and loud at the wrap point.**
  `next_ckp_id`, `savepoint_seq` and `cache_pushes` incremented with a bare `+= 1`. The stakes
  are higher than bookkeeping: the checkpoint ids are what make the live-checkpoint list
  sorted-ascending, and this release's `contains` / `pop_through` fast paths are binary searches
  *licensed by* that sortedness — a wrapped id violates it with nothing to say so. Each
  increment now panics by name instead of rolling over, following the CST sink's own witness
  counter. 2^64 is not a practical horizon; the point is that a shipped optimization's
  precondition cannot break in silence.
  — *(R10)*

- **The session-point abandonment law is written where users read it.** An abandoned point
  commits, and the campaign carried that to the end as an open *policy decision* between
  commit, rollback and a hybrid. Two of the three are not buildable: `Session::drop` holds the
  lineage and the emitter but not the input, so it cannot restore span, state or cursor —
  "rollback on abandon" is unwritable from that site, and the one thing that is writable
  (rewinding emissions while keeping the position) is the torn state the settle discipline
  exists to prevent. A drop-time `debug_assert` is refused too: abandonment via `?` through an
  enclosing rollback is a legal history. Documented, not changed.
  — *(R10)*

- **`commit_probed`'s temporal contract is enforced in debug builds.** A close payload is valid
  only while the committed cursor sits where `probe_close` left it — everything in the gap,
  including the end-state pass the deferred drivers run there, must be cursor-neutral. That
  lived in prose. The payload now carries the probe-time committed position behind
  `debug_assertions` and the commit checks it, so an edit that consumes or rewinds in the gap
  names itself instead of settling the wrong token. `ClosePayload` is crate-internal, so no
  public surface moves.
  — *(R10)*

- **`Fatal`'s `Default` and `Debug` are `Lang`-generic**, like its `Clone`/`Copy` and like
  `Silent`'s twins. They were written `impl<T: ?Sized> ... for Fatal<T>` — `Fatal<T, ()>` only —
  so `Fatal::<E, MyLang>::default()` did not resolve and a branded `Fatal` could not be printed
  at all. Additive: impls widen, and the render at `Lang = ()` is unchanged.
  — *(R10)*

- **A transposed compile-assert now pins something.** `Ignored`'s no-op `SeparatedEmitter`
  assert instantiated the trait as `<'a, Sep, L>` — separator in the lexer slot, lexer in the
  language slot — and compiled anyway, because `Ignored` implements the trait for any parameters
  at all. An assert over an unconstrained type type-checks whatever you hand it. Rewritten at
  the real signature and exercised at both an unbranded and a branded language; transposing the
  slots back now fails the build.
  — *(R10)*

- **`Emitter::emit_lexer_error`'s contract says what an `Err` return means.** Under a rejecting
  emitter the `Err` **is** the delivery: the input layer advances its dedup watermark *before*
  calling, so a later scan over the same region will not offer the diagnostic again. The
  natural reading is the opposite one, which is why it is now written down at the trait and at
  `Fatal`'s impl.
  — *(R10)*

- **Documentation that was false, corrected rather than softened.** Four `find_boundary` docs
  claimed the result "is always a valid slice position" *and* that indices at or beyond the end
  come back unchanged — which cannot both hold, since `len + 1` returned unchanged is not a
  slice position. They now state the rounding direction (**down**), the in-range guarantee, and
  the out-of-range behaviour separately, and the trait-level doc gains the word "down" it was
  missing. `Transaction`'s "the guard is two words" is replaced by the measured truth: the
  guard embeds a whole `Checkpoint` — cursor, span, `L::State`, two `u64` marks, poison
  boundary — 88 bytes with a near-stateless lexer and `O(size_of::<L::State>())` in general.
  Its op-count claims were true and are kept. `utils::cmp`'s backing list now names `BStr` and
  the `smol_bytes` family, which it implements.
  — *(R10)*

- **`UnclosedEmitter::emit_unclosed`'s `FromUnclosed` bound placement is recorded as chosen.**
  It sits on the method rather than on the trait so an emitter that never routes an unclosed
  pair pays nothing; hoisting it would force every implementor's error type to carry the
  conversion unconditionally. Documented so a later cleanup does not "fix" it.
  — *(R10)*

- **The collection gate's own census could pass by not looking.** `parser::many`'s `GATE_CENSUS`
  read four hard-coded sources and counted one exact spelling of the swallow beneath the gate —
  `emit_error(Spanned::new(span,`. A swallow spelled any other way, or written in a fifth source,
  moved neither tally, so the equality it asserted still held and the census stayed green over an
  ungated emit-and-continue site. A census quoted as evidence that answers by not looking is worse
  than none.

  The swallow is now a single chokepoint — one `emit_error` call in the whole `many`/`fold` tree,
  with the three never-recoverable witnesses above it — so a driver physically has nothing to spell
  differently. The census matches the **call** rather than its arguments and asserts the count is
  zero in every driver source; it scans the chokepoint's own body for the three witnesses ahead of
  the emission; and a third test requires every module of the driver trees to be classified, so the
  source list cannot fall behind the tree. Every scan panics when the thing it looks for is absent
  instead of finding nothing to check. Shown non-vacuous by planting a swallow in a fifth source
  with a spelling the old shape did not match — it fails, naming the file, then the plant was
  removed. No behaviour change. — *(#148, verification debt)*

  **And the same defect, one level in: the witness scan proved presence, not gating.** The scan
  above requires each of the three never-recoverable witnesses to appear once in the source ahead
  of the emission. Textual presence ahead of a call is not control-flow domination — a body that
  reads all three into `let _ =` bindings and then emits unconditionally satisfies it with the gate
  entirely gone. Compiled and run: the census stayed green.

  Answered by mutation rather than by a stronger scan, since proving domination from source text
  means writing a Rust parser inside a test module that must also build under
  `--no-default-features`. Each witness was neutered in turn and the whole `--all-features` suite
  run: the frontier-`Incomplete` witness and the descent-trip witness each red tests — and
  **`at_committed_boundary()` red nothing at all**, in the entire suite. Its only cell was negative
  (a boundary the cursor has *not* reached must not be charged to an ordinary failure), which a
  deleted witness also satisfies. Unguarded, a collection that runs onto a poison boundary files
  the stop as an ordinary syntax error and returns a **silently truncated success** — `Ok` over
  input the scanner never read.

  `tokora/tests/collection_terminal_stop.rs` gains the positive direction: five `r1b_*` cells, one
  per try-driven family plus the truncation case, each with the file's non-vacuity control (the
  same probe run twice with only the scan limit changed, required to disagree, and required to have
  actually tripped). All five are red under the mutation and green without it. The census now states
  what a needle scan proves and names the suite that proves the rest, and both it and the
  chokepoint's own docs carry the re-check procedure. No behaviour change. — *(#148, verification
  debt)*

- **The recursion-limit test suite's stack-address witness made every Miri job and the ASan job
  red, on `main`.** `pratt_limit_unit_sink`'s unwind cell corroborates its two depth-cell
  assertions out-of-band by comparing the addresses of two stack locals. That comparison measures
  frame liveness only while the addresses are native stack offsets: ASan can relocate a frame's
  locals onto a heap-allocated fake stack and Miri hands out virtual allocation addresses. Three of
  four instrumented hosts measured the *unwound* frame as farther from the baseline than the
  descent it had already left — inverted operands, so no threshold rescues the comparison — while a
  fourth (ASan on aarch64-darwin) passed on the same source. A relation whose answer changes with
  the runner is reporting the runner, so it is now scoped to native builds via `cfg!(miri)` plus a
  `TOKORA_SANITIZER` variable `ci/sanitizer.sh` exports for every leg it runs.

  The two depth-cell assertions stay **active** under Miri and every sanitizer, and the gated one
  is not replaced by a second library-side counter: reading the same cell twice is not
  corroboration. A skipped assertion announces itself on the process's real stderr — not through
  `eprintln!`, which libtest swallows for a passing test — so the one build where the check does
  not run is not the one build where nobody can see that. — *(#148, verification debt)*

- **`pratt_limit`'s deep-stack wall-clock bound was calibrated for the wrong machine, and it made
  the `miri-tb-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` leg intermittently red on `main`.** `on_a_deep_stack`
  bounds every deep-recursion cell to a fixed number of seconds so a recursion-limit regression
  fails the test with a message instead of hanging the process. Under interpretation that number
  measures the interpreter, not the parser, and not by a flat factor: `-Zmiri-tree-borrows`
  revalidates a growing borrow tree on every access, so
  `the_default_budget_refuses_a_deeper_chain_and_unlimited_restores_it`'s 1000-level `unlimited()`
  chain — this file's deepest cell — scales worse than linearly with depth, not by the roughly two
  orders of magnitude a flat per-step slowdown would predict. Measured directly, with the exact
  command and `-tb` flags `ci/miri_tb.sh` runs: 60–69s across three runs on aarch64-apple-darwin —
  already more than half of the native 120s bound, on a different host and architecture than the
  `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` shared runner CI failed on, which is why that leg flaked instead of
  failing outright every time.

  The bound is now `cfg!(miri)`-scoped: 700 seconds under Miri — a ×10 margin over the slower
  reading, sized for the cross-host and shared-runner gap CI had already demonstrated, not just
  this machine's own run-to-run noise — and 120 seconds, unchanged, natively. The bound's purpose
  is untouched: a genuine hang is still caught, on a schedule that fits the machine actually
  running it, and the native path carries no behaviour change — an unlimited native run finishes
  in hundredths of a second, nowhere near either number. — *(#148, verification debt)*

- **The name-collision gate reported an incomplete verdict as if it were a result.**
  `gen_probe.py` had no template for the owners #147 introduced, so every row on them came back
  `FATAL`. Templates alone were not enough: a probe naming an owner the same diff introduces cannot
  compile against the base ref, and base-no-compile was unconditionally `INCONCL`. A new
  `new-owner` verdict says exactly that, and carries two witnesses so it cannot be manufactured —
  rustc must name the owner as unresolved on base and must not on head. The verdict is complete
  now: 27/27 rows probed, 0 FATAL, 0 INCONCL, 0 UNPROBED. — *(#148, verification debt)*

- **That verdict proved base was broken and never checked that head ran.** Its two witnesses
  required rustc to name the owner unresolved on base and to stay silent about it on head — but
  silence is also what a head build broken for an unrelated reason looks like: `no-compile`,
  `upstream-fail`, `bad-witness(...)` and `unreached` none say the owner is unresolved either, so a
  head that failed to compile the probe for a reason having nothing to do with the owner — or that
  never reached the call at all — still read as proof the owner is new. `new-owner` now
  additionally requires head to show a completed run, checked by an allowlist of the one shape
  that is evidence (`witness=*`) rather than a denylist of the shapes already known to be broken,
  which is silent about the next one nobody has named yet. Re-run against a genuine pre-#147 base,
  9 of the 14 `RecursionLimitReached` rows the prior entry counted turn out to have been passing on
  exactly this hole: `map_offset` and `of`'s templates call the real method with fewer arguments
  than it takes, and the other five methods' `used` spelling forces a `u8` return type none of them
  have, so head never compiled on any of the nine. They now score `INCONCL`, correctly — only the
  five methods whose `discarded` spelling silently and successfully calls the real inherent method
  were ever provable, and the fix does not widen to paper over the rest. — *(#148, verification
  debt)*

- **That fix's own allowlist was still too wide, and a sibling verdict had none at all.**
  `new-owner`'s `case "$h" in witness=*)` accepts `witness=1` exactly as readily as `witness=0` —
  but the marker is CONSUMER-CALLS, attribution rather than existence (see the comment where it is
  assigned), and `witness=1` means the CONSUMER's own extension item took the call, i.e. the
  probed name on the new owner was never a candidate this run. A template that compiles clean
  while constructing no real collision would still have scored `new-owner`. The allowlist now
  requires `witness=0*` specifically — the one shape that says tokora's item won the resolution —
  and a `witness=1` head reads `INCONCL`, naming the reason.

  Separately, the `glob-err`/`glob-ok` verdicts intercepted only the LITERAL STRING `no-compile` on
  the base side before trusting head's evidence. A base broken for any other reason —
  `upstream-fail` chief among them — fell through into the head-only checks and let a head-side
  ambiguity decide the verdict alone, with no valid before-state at all. The base side is now
  checked against an allowlist too: `no-compile` or `unreached` (the only two shapes a
  compiling-or-rejected glob probe can produce, since `glob_name`/`glob_macro`'s `drive()` calls
  only `ran()` and never `reached()`), anything else `INCONCL`.

  Both proved in the failing direction, against a real glob collision and a real `new-owner` row,
  then reverted — `git diff` confirmed clean before this fix was committed. A forced
  `base=upstream-fail` alongside a genuine head-side ambiguity moved the glob row from `glob-err`
  to `INCONCL`; a forced `witness=1` (explicit UFCS on the consumer trait, bypassing inherent-method
  resolution) on a real `new-owner` row moved it from `new-owner` to `INCONCL`. Re-run against the
  same pre-#147 base as the prior entry, the tally is unchanged — 5 `new-owner`, 9 `INCONCL` —
  because none of the 14 real rows there naturally produce `witness=1`; only the forced case
  exercises the new branch. — *(#148, verification debt)*

- **That base-side allowlist had a mirror-image hole on the head side, and it was the more
  exploitable of the two.** After the fix above, `glob-ok`'s only remaining check was
  `elif [ -n "$said" ]` — accept once rustc says *something* ambiguity-shaped anywhere in the
  head log, with no check on `$h` itself. `upstream-fail`, `bad-witness(...)` and any
  `witness=*` all read as a pass exactly as readily as a genuine `unreached`, so a head build
  broken for a reason having nothing to do with the probed name — provided an attributed
  ambiguity diagnostic happened to be sitting in the same log — still scored `glob-ok`. That is
  acceptance on the absence of a completed head-side probe: the same defect class the base-side
  fix above had just closed, on the other side of the same row.

  `h` is now held to the identical two-shape allowlist as `b`: `no-compile` or `unreached`,
  because `glob_name`/`glob_macro`'s `drive()` calls only `ran()` and never `reached()` — a head
  that actually finishes compiling and running can only ever read `unreached` here, never
  `witness=*`. `glob-ok` now requires `h = unreached` specifically; `upstream-fail`,
  `bad-witness(...)` and any `witness=*` read `INCONCL`, naming the reason, instead of falling
  through.

  Proved in the failing direction against the same pre-#147 base and the same
  `RecursionLimitReached` glob row as the prior entry: a forced `head=upstream-fail` alongside
  the row's genuine, untouched ambiguity diagnostic moved it from `glob-ok` to `INCONCL`; forcing
  `bad-witness(calls=2,reached=0)`, `witness=0` and `witness=1` the same way each land `INCONCL`
  too. Reverted afterward; `git diff` confirmed clean before this fix was committed. Re-run
  unperturbed, the same row reaches its natural `glob-err` verdict, unchanged from before this
  fix.

  Audited the rest of the file for the same asymmetry — a verdict proving one side reached a
  conclusion without proving the other did. `new-owner`'s two witnesses already check
  `base_unresolved` and `head_unresolved` by the same predicate, and the item-row ladder's
  `unreached`/`upstream-fail`/`bad-witness` filter matches against `"$b$h"` concatenated, which
  catches either side by construction; the base-only `case "$b" in witness=1*|no-compile)`
  further down is not a shape gap of this kind; it fixes the pre-release baseline's expected
  value, and every value `$h` can still hold past it is already handled by name in the branches
  below. This glob-row pair was the only place in the file carrying an allowlist on one side and
  none on the other. — *(#148, verification debt)*

- **`gen_probe.py`'s two newest templates assumed a call shape neither real method has, so 9 of
  the 14 rows the entry above counted could only ever read `INCONCL`.**
  `error_subject_method`/`error_subject_assoc_fn` — added for
  `RecursionLimitReached`/`NonAssociativeChain` — rode the same fixed zero-argument, `-> u8`
  consumer shape every other inherent-method/assoc-fn template does. That shape fits neither
  type: `map_offset` consumes `self` and takes a closure, `of` takes the type's own fields (two
  arguments on `RecursionLimitReached`, one on `NonAssociativeChain`), and none of the five plain
  accessors (`offset`, `offset_ref`, `exceeded`, `depth`, `limitation`) returns `u8`. The emitted
  call failed to compile on the head side before rustc ever reached the collision —
  `map_offset`/`of` with E0061 (too few arguments), the other five's `used` spelling with E0308
  (the `let`-binding's forced type) — which is exactly the hole the entry above named and left
  open: "the fix does not widen to paper over the rest."

  Both templates now derive the call's arity, and the `used` spelling's `let`-binding type, from
  the REAL signature instead of assuming one. Verified two-sided, against the same genuine
  pre-#147 base the entries above use (`60f27a3`): before this fix the 14 `RecursionLimitReached`
  rows scored 5 `new-owner` / 9 `INCONCL`, matching the count already on record; after, all 14
  score `new-owner`, each on a head run that compiled and completed (`CONSUMER-CALLS: 0` —
  tokora's own item took every call). No effect on this branch's own run: it adds no name
  reusing either owner, so it scores `probes=0`/`PASS` regardless — the fix matters the next
  time a PR gives one of these two types a genuinely new item. — *(#148, verification debt)*



55. **A `trace`-feature preview no longer reports a partial `Debug` rendering as the complete,
 short value it is not.** `bounded_debug` — the bounded sink `trace_preview` (behind the
 `trace` feature) uses to build its per-event source preview — discarded the `Result` from its
 own `write!` call outright, so its truncation flag came from the sink's private bookkeeping
 alone: `true` only when the sink itself had refused a write after filling its 24-character
 window. A `Debug` impl can fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the sink —
 `fmt::Result` is a plain `Result`, and neither the trait nor `Slice`'s bound (`PartialEq + Eq
 + Debug`) forbids it — and that case left the flag `false`: the preview then rendered
 whatever partial content had been written, with no ellipsis, as though it were the whole
 value.

 The single flag is replaced with a three-state outcome — `Complete`, `WindowTruncated`, or
 `FormatFailed` — because a bool cannot carry both facts a reader needs kept apart: whether
 there is more of the value than the window shows, and whether the value's own `Debug` impl
 finished at all. Folding a foreign `Err` into the same flag a real truncation sets is just as
 wrong in the other direction: a `Debug` impl can write its complete, short rendering and only
 then fail for a reason of its own, and reporting that as truncated appends `…` to a trace
 line for a value that has no more content, claiming a continuation that does not exist.

 The sink's own bookkeeping (`sink.truncated`) is what tells the two causes apart, and does so
 reliably: the sink has exactly one branch that ever returns `Err`, and that branch sets
 `sink.truncated` in the same statement, so a `write!` failure the sink did not record cannot
 be the sink's. `trace_preview` now renders each state distinctly — no marker for `Complete`,
 `…` for `WindowTruncated`, and a separate `<fmt error>` marker for `FormatFailed` that says
 the renderer broke without claiming missing content. This is a correctness fix, not a
 performance one: it changes output only for a `Debug` impl that fails on its own account,
 which no in-tree `Source`/`Slice` pairing does, so every case that already reached the sink
 normally — which is to say, every case this crate has ever exercised — renders
 byte-identically to before.

56. **A recursion-limit trip an element ANSWERED was still spendable — as a successful, complete
   collection.** Item 48 above closes the path where an element hands its trip back as `Err`: the
   collection drivers gate that at one chokepoint and re-raise it. They gated **only** that path.
   An element that catches [`RecursionLimitReached`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/error/struct.RecursionLimitReached.html)
   itself and then reports *no more elements* — by declining, or by accepting without consuming
   anything — hands the driver an `Ok`, the chokepoint never runs, and the driver's **absence** exit
   reads it as the ordinary end of the construct. `repeated()`, `separated_by(..)` and both
   delimited forms returned `Ok` with everything collected so far, filing nothing. A resource
   budget stopped the parse and the parse reported a complete construct — the same defect as item 48,
   for every error type equally, reached through the exit item 48's gate does not cover.

   The absence exits now consult the same session counter, at the same per-element granularity, and
   through a second chokepoint of their own: nine exits across the four drivers — the element
   decline, the no-progress stall, and in the delimited pair the close probe's `WrongToken` and
   `Eof` arms — surface the stop as the terminal-marked end-of-input error those exits already
   produced for a *scanner* stop, instead of ending the construct cleanly.

   | driving an element that catches a depth trip and then reports absence | before | now |
   |---|---|---|
   | `repeated()`, `separated_by(..)`, and both delimited forms | `Ok` with the elements collected before the stop, nothing filed | `Err` — a terminal end-of-input, still nothing filed |

   **Unchanged here, and deliberately so**: the *scanner* half of this gate stays off an exit
   resting on a **real token**. A `Close` verdict from the delimited drivers' close probe, and the
   mid-scan closer in the delimited separated driver, read a committed pre-trip token, so the
   construct ended *ahead of* any boundary a later lookahead latched and a wider scan window parses
   the identical source to the identical value. The *descent* half of it is a different kind of fact
   and does belong on those exits — item 57 below is that correction. An `Accept` is untouched either
   way, and stays that way: an element that catches a trip and still returns a value has answered
   it, not concluded absence, so the driver is faithfully collecting what it was handed rather than
   manufacturing a stop of its own — item 48 above states this as the fourth channel a caught trip
   can still spend, and why gating it would be a broader contract than #148 establishes. And
   the granularity floor item 48 describes is exactly the same here — the baseline is one
   **element**, so a trip an *earlier* element caught and parsed past does not end the collection
   when a later one legitimately runs out of input.

   The eight `*_while` drivers and folds shared this hole; **item 58 below closes it** for them, and
   the measurement that found it is recorded there. — *(#148 R7)*

57. **A closer that arrives after the trip does not unmake it.** Item 56 gated the delimited drivers'
   *absence* exits and left the arm where the closer is genuinely present ungated, on the reasoning
   that a committed pre-trip closer settles the question. It settles **one** of the two questions,
   and the two are facts of different kinds:

   - a terminal **scanner** stop is a fact about a token *position*. The close probe is cache-first,
     so a `Close` verdict rests on a real pre-trip token: the construct ended *ahead of* whatever
     boundary the element's lookahead went on to latch, and that boundary is not about it. Reading it
     there would fail a parse a wider scan window completes to the identical value, so it still does
     not — unchanged from item 56;
   - a **descent** budget trip is a *counter event that already happened inside the element attempt*.
     Nothing arriving afterwards unmakes it. An element that caught a
     [`RecursionLimitReached`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/error/struct.RecursionLimitReached.html),
     reported *no more elements*, and was then followed by a real closer produced a **successfully
     closed collection that had silently spent a resource-limit stop** — item 56's defect, through the
     one arm item 56's gate deliberately does not cover.

   Three exits now consult the trip counter before they commit a real closer, at the same
   per-element granularity: `repeated().delimited()`'s decline arm and its no-progress epilogue, and
   `separated_by(..).delimited()`'s epilogue.

   | driving an element that catches a depth trip, reports absence, and IS followed by the closer | before | now |
   |---|---|---|
   | `repeated().delimited()` over `"( 1 2 3 )"`, element declines | `Ok([1, 2, 3])`, nothing filed | `Err` — a terminal end-of-input, still nothing filed |
   | `repeated().delimited()` over `"( 1 2 3 )"`, element accepts consuming nothing | `Ok([1, 2, 3, …])`, nothing filed | `Err` — likewise |
   | `separated_by(..).delimited()`, element consumes and declines before the closer | `Ok([1, 2, 3])`, nothing filed | `Err` — likewise |

   **Still unchanged**: the mid-scan closer in `separated_by(..).delimited()`. It is reached from the
   top of a cycle, so only an *accepting* element can precede it — a decline and a stall each break
   into the epilogue — and the cycle's baseline is taken above it, which makes the term a constant
   `false` there. An `Accept` remains untouched everywhere, for the reason item 56 gives.

   The two delimited `*_while` drivers have real-closer exits too, and **item 58 below** brings them
   under the same gate. `parser::many`'s `GATE_CENSUS` gains a per-source count of real-closer exits
   with a region scan requiring each close verdict to reach the gate before it commits, plus a
   two-directional scan of the gate itself — the counter read, the position *not* read, since a
   scanner term smuggled in there is as much a defect as a missing descent one. — *(#148 R8)*

58. **The same trip, through the same absence exits, in the other eight drivers.** Items 56 and 57
   closed this for the four **try-driven** collection families and recorded the other eight
   guard-bearing sources — `repeated_while()`, `separated_by_*_while()`, both of their delimited
   forms, and the fold sources behind `fold`/`try_fold`/`try_fold_with`/`rfold` and their four
   `*_while` twins — as *found, not fixed*. They are fixed now.

   Their exposure was **narrower** than the four's, not different: none of them files an element's
   `Err`, so a trip an element *hands back* propagates untouched and was already terminal there. The
   hole was the exit with no `Err` in it — an element that catches
   [`RecursionLimitReached`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/error/struct.RecursionLimitReached.html)
   itself and then reports *no more elements*. Measured rather than inferred, on the code as it
   stood:

   | driving an element that catches a depth trip and then reports absence | before | now |
   |---|---|---|
   | `fold(..)` over `"1 2 3"`, element declines | `Ok(6)` under a budget the element exceeds — identical to `Ok(6)` under one it does not | `Err` — a terminal end-of-input, still nothing filed |
   | `repeated_while(..)` over `"1 2 3"`, element accepts consuming nothing | `Ok([1, 2, 3, -1])` under both budgets | `Err` — likewise |

   Closing it needed a per-**element** trip baseline none of those loops took, which is a shape
   change rather than a gate addition: three of the folds were `while let Accept(..) = element(..)`
   loops, and a `while let`'s condition *is* the element attempt, so there is nowhere in one to
   snapshot the counter before it. Those three are now `loop { let trips = …; match … }`. The
   remaining five take the baseline at the top of the cycle, which is once per element, since a
   cycle attempts at most one.

   Thirty absence exits across all twelve sources now route through `absence_after_element`, and
   eight real-closer exits through `close_after_element` — every `CloseStatus::Close` verdict in the
   tree, with **no per-site exemption**. Where a probe sits at the top of a cycle its descent term is
   a constant `false`, and the call is kept anyway: a `usize` comparison costs less than an
   exemption table, it fails closed if a later refactor moves an element attempt above the probe,
   and it is what lets the census scan each verdict's own arm instead of comparing tallies. The two
   **direct** closers — `separated_by_*(..).delimited()`'s and `separated_by_*_while(..).delimited()`'s
   mid-scan arms, which commit from the driver's own scan with no probe verdict — stay exempt for
   the structural reason item 57 gives, and are counted as such.

   **Unchanged, and deliberately so**: an `Accept` is still never gated, in any of the twelve, for
   the reason item 56 states. So is each `*_while` driver's `Action::Stop` exit in practice — it is
   reached before that cycle's element runs, so the element that could have caught a trip is the
   previous cycle's *accepting* one, and the term there is a constant `false` by construction rather
   than by exemption.

   `parser::many`'s `GATE_CENSUS` loses its two-shape classification: `absence_exit_shapes` has no
   zeroes left, every source is required to spell **neither** witness itself, and a new
   `every_driver_baselines_its_trip_witness_inside_its_element_loop` pins one `trip_snapshot()` per
   element loop in all twelve — matched against the loop openers as a second, independent needle —
   and requires every one of the forty-two chokepoint calls to read a baseline taken inside the loop
   that hosts it. — *(#148 R9)*


59. **A trivia skip whose predicate panics no longer loses the token it was asked about.** On a
   [`Complete`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/input/struct.Complete.html) input,
   [`skip_while`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/input/struct.InputRef.html#method.skip_while)
   reaches its lexer once the stream is drained, and the token it lexes was handed to the
   predicate while nothing owned it. A predicate that unwound therefore dropped that token: the
   call resumed from the previously committed span and the next read **re-lexed** it, where the
   same skip on a sealed
   [`Partial`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/input/struct.Partial.html) input — whose scan
   scope holds the token for exactly this reason — put it back at the front of the stream and
   resumed there. Two typestates, one primitive, two different resume cursors under
   `catch_unwind`.

   The token is now owned by a guard across that one call, so an unwinding predicate leaves it
   parked rather than dropped, and the ordinary stop and the unwind edge perform the identical
   put-back. **For an unwind out of the predicate** — at every call, over every residency and cache
   capacity swept — both routes now leave the same cursor, the same front residency and the same
   amount of re-lexing. They still part company on one other exit, an unwind inside the
   end-of-input settle, which was left as it is on purpose; entry 54 below says why and names the
   cell that pins it.

   Visible only to a host that catches an unwind out of its own `skip_while` predicate and keeps
   using the input; a predicate that returns normally, or a panic that aborts, is unaffected.

   **It gives back about three fifths of entry 54's win — the two fifths that remain are what
   ships — and that is stated rather than buried.** Measured on the same harness and in the same
   interleaved runs as the figure there: 1321.0 µs → 1482.5 µs on the 57 kB document and 133.7 µs →
   148.1 µs on the 7.5 kB one, so **+12.2% and +10.8%** of a whole parse. Entry 54's route was 17.4%
   and 15.9% faster than the previous release line before this guard and is 7.4% and 6.9% faster
   with it, so the guard hands back 10.0 of those 17.4 points and 9.0 of those 15.9 — 57.5% and
   56.6%.

   The whole of the cost is the **unwind cleanup region** a destructor opens in the lexing loop,
   not the guard's own work: the identical wrapper with its `Drop` deleted is free, and so is the
   guard itself compiled `panic = "abort"`. Six shapes were built and timed and this is the
   cheapest — scoping the guard tighter, taking its `Drop` out of line, moving the predicate call
   into a non-inlined helper, and outlining the whole lexing phase are all worse or no better. The
   resident-token path — the 22,033-of-39,057 skips that skip nothing, and every skip over a warm
   cache — builds no guard and is unaffected.

   It was judged correct to pay because a panicking predicate is **contract-covered behaviour**,
   not undefined territory: `skip_while` documents a *Panic unwind* section promising that no token
   leaves the stream, and the predicate is explicitly outside the "inert callbacks" precondition
   that scopes the rest of the fast path's guarantees. Two typestates disagreeing there falsifies a
   documented promise, and entry 54's own claim rests on panic tests as its evidence.

   **That same reasoning is why the other divergence was not paid for.** The end-of-input settle
   exclusion in entry 54 is reachable only through the lexer, the source, the span or the offset —
   all of them *inside* the inert-callbacks precondition, so no caller who meets the condition can
   provoke it — and the complete-input route's answer there is the stronger of the two, not a
   defect being tolerated. Where a promise was over-broad the promise was narrowed and the
   behaviour pinned; where the behaviour was wrong, as it was for the predicate, it was fixed.

   The differential sweep that should have caught this could not: its check on where the stream
   resumes was a *range* between the committed position and the next token's start, and a token
   put back and a token dropped are both inside it. It is an equality now, and a new cell compares
   the two typestate routes field by field after a panicking predicate — cursor, front residency,
   whether the token was re-lexed, and the committed-token notifications the interrupted call had
   already made. That last is also a new observer for a gap noted and left open in the previous
   round: `Emitter::commit_token` reaches no value a caller reads back off the input, so a skip
   that consumed a **parked** token and told nobody had, until now, nothing watching it.

60. **The same wrong-machine wall-clock bound was still sitting in `pratt_limit_unit_sink`, and it
   took the `miri-tb-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` leg red on `main` — 57 minutes in.** The entry
   further up this section corrected `pratt_limit`'s deep-stack bound and did not sweep for
   siblings. There was one: `bounded`, the wall every cell in `pratt_limit_unit_sink` runs under,
   with 60 seconds hard-coded at all thirty-one call sites. On a compiled build 60 seconds is
   enormous — this file's slowest cell, the section 3 unwind cell, runs in 9.8–10.4 ms and no
   other cell reaches a millisecond — and under interpretation it is a coin flip. Measured with
   the exact command and `-tb` flags `ci/miri_tb.sh` runs, timing the interval `bounded` itself
   bounds:

   | | native | Miri, aarch64-apple-darwin | slowdown |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | the unwind cell, alone | 9.8 ms | 49.72s / 48.61s | about ×4,800 |
   | the unwind cell, in a whole-file run | 10.4 ms | 49.32s | about ×4,800 |
   | all sixteen cells | 10 ms | 58.02s | — |

   So the cell is essentially the whole file, which is why CI reported a single failing cell
   rather than general slowness. The bound is now 500 seconds under Miri and 60 natively,
   unchanged. 500 is ×10 over the slowest reading, the same multiple the deep-stack bound chose,
   and this time the cross-host gap has a measured floor rather than an argument: the same cell
   that reads 49.7s here tripped a 60s wall on the shared `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` runner, so
   that runner is at least ×1.21 slower on an interpreted workload of this shape. A tripped
   deadline reports "over the budget" and never by how much, so ×1.21 is a floor; ×10 leaves room
   over it and over a pessimistic ×3 draw on a noisy runner alike. It is deliberately not larger,
   because a budget is also a bill the job pays if a termination regression ever lands: sixteen
   cells at 500 seconds is 2h13, inside the job timeout, where an hour a cell would be a way of
   never finding out.

   **The two bounds are now one bound.** Both suites' helpers were the same function modulo a
   stack size and a number, and keeping them separate is what let the first fix miss the second
   site. They now both call `common::bounded_wait`, whose allowance is a `WallClock` — a pair of
   figures, one per build kind, both required. A third suite that needs a wall cannot spell one
   without saying what an interpreted build is allowed, which is the property that was missing,
   and `bounded_wait` refuses a pair whose interpreted figure is below its native one, because
   interpretation is not the faster of the two and such a pair is transposed rather than measured.
   Each call site keeps its own measured number and its own reasoning; only the mechanism is
   shared.

   The deep-stack bound's 700 seconds was re-read under Miri with the refactor in place and is
   unchanged — its own doc records the cross-check. No library behaviour changes, and the native
   path is untouched: every cell here finishes in single-digit milliseconds, nowhere near either
   figure. — *(#148, verification debt)*

61. **A scanner resource trip is now terminal for every emitter, not only for the ones that accept
   its diagnostic — recovery re-raises it instead of retrying it.** Item 48 answered the *descent*
   side of "terminality is a property of the event, and this crate enumerates carriers of it". This
   is the *scanner* side of the same root cause, and it was reachable through every fail-fast
   emitter.

   One trip, one position, one committed leaf, two emitters, two verdicts. An **accepting** emitter
   files the trip's diagnostic and the committed leaf
   ([`next_or_stop`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/input/struct.InputRef.html#method.next_or_stop),
   [`try_expect_or_stop`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/input/struct.InputRef.html#method.try_expect_or_stop))
   builds an
   [`UnexpectedEot`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/error/struct.UnexpectedEot.html) through
   `into_terminal`, so `is_terminal()` is `true` and recovery re-raises. A **rejecting** emitter
   reports the same trip by returning `Err` from
   [`emit_lexer_error`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/emitter/trait.Emitter.html#method.emit_lexer_error) —
   which is not a refusal to report, it *is* the report — and the scanner propagates that value
   straight out of its trip arm. It was built by `FromEmitterError::from_lexer_error` from the
   lexer's own `Token::Error`; no `UnexpectedEnd` exists on that path, so nothing calls
   `into_terminal` and `is_terminal()` is `false`. Recovery then **ran**: measured through
   [`recover`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/trait.ParseInput.html#method.recover) under
   [`Fatal`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/emitter/struct.Fatal.html), the recoverer
   re-entered the scanner and re-tripped the same limit — scan count 3 → 4 — and returned `Ok`,
   turning a spent resource budget into a successful parse. All four recovery attempts were
   affected: `recover`,
   [`inplace_recover`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/trait.ParseInput.html#method.inplace_recover),
   and both of
   [`skip_then_retry`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/trait.ParseInput.html#method.skip_then_retry)'s
   attempts.

   **The witness already existed and those four sites were the only guarded ones not reading it.**
   The input's poison boundary is the scanner's own record of the trip, and `parser::many`'s twelve
   collection drivers consult it at every absence exit through `latch_snapshot` /
   `latched_during_attempt`. The four recovery sites consulted it zero times. They now read it,
   beside `MaybeTerminal::is_terminal` and the session trip counter — five witnesses, in the five
   places the two never-recoverable conditions are stored.

   **The scanner's witness is a monotone COUNTER, not the boundary that trip latched, and that is
   the whole of the fix.** The boundary is a *lineage memo*: a `Checkpoint` carries it and a restore
   copies it back verbatim. Any comparison of it across a rollback therefore reads a restored value
   against what it was restored to, and moving the comparison closes exactly one level at a time:

   - read **after** the attempt, it compares the latch `try_attempt`'s `Err` arm just restored
     against the value it restored it to — always equal, always `false`. Measured: with the read
     there, only the non-backtracking `inplace_recover` cell passed and all three speculating ones
     still failed with the scanner re-entered after the trip.
   - read **inside** the attempt, that level is closed and the level below opens. Grammar code may
     catch a scanner stop inside an *inner* `attempt` of its own and decline it; the inner rollback
     restores the boundary before the outer gate ever looks, and the outer verdict reads clean over
     a stop that is live, already diagnosed, and re-trips on the next scan of the same prefix.
     Measured the same way: the recoverer ran and the scan count moved 3 → 4.

   Relocating the read a third time closes level two and opens level three. **A cell inside the
   rollback set cannot witness an event across a rollback at any depth**, so the witness is a cell
   no rollback reaches: a new `Input::scanner_trips`, monotone, never lowered, not carried by a
   `Checkpoint` and not by the sync family's `ThroughEntry` either. It is the exact twin of the
   descent counter item 48 added, for the other budget, and it is classified in the same place —
   `input::lineage`'s CELL_CENSUS destructures `Input` exhaustively, so the field could not be added
   without a row in the taxonomy table saying what a restore does to it. Its **one writer** is
   `latch_if_limit_tripped`, the crate's sole terminal predicate: `classify` is its only caller and
   both lexing drivers reach `classify`, so *every* scanner trip is counted, a lookahead's included
   — and a lookahead that trips latches the boundary and still returns `Ok` with a short window,
   which is precisely the trip a driver-level count in `scan_with`'s `Verdict::Trip` arm would have
   missed. The bump runs before the diagnostic is offered to the emitter, so a rejecting emitter's
   `Err` cannot carry the stop out past an uncounted trip.

   The latch reading is **kept** beside it, and demoted rather than deleted: it answers "a different
   stop is standing at the end of this attempt" where the counter answers "a stop happened inside
   it", and every transition this crate can produce that moves the latch also moves the counter. It
   costs one `Option<L::Offset>` clone on a path that already clones one, and removing a witness on
   a subsumption argument is removing it on an argument rather than on a measurement. The witnesses
   are still read **inside** the attempt, for that narrow term's sake, and the verdict rides out
   beside the error.

   **The guard is now one chokepoint rather than four copies, and the false justification that let
   the copies drift is gone.** A new crate-internal `parser::recovery_gate` owns the whole judgement
   — every per-attempt baseline and all five witnesses — and the combinators hand it their attempt
   and match on a three-way outcome. Nothing about the law is spelled at a call site, which also
   deletes a hoistable baseline: `skip_then_retry`'s retry-cycle `trip_snapshot()` had to stay
   inside the retry loop (hoisted, the monotone session counter would refuse every retry after the
   parse's first trip) and nothing checked that it did. There is no longer a baseline there to
   hoist. The comment above the old `Recover` guard claimed the error's own answer "covers a
   *scanner* stop, which the grammar's error type carries" — the first half of which is exactly this
   defect; it is corrected rather than deleted, along with
   [`MaybeTerminal`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/error/trait.MaybeTerminal.html)'s "the arm
   is yours to answer for" clause, which is now true of a
   [`PartialSession`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/input/struct.PartialSession.html)'s
   terminal latch and no longer of the three recovery combinators.

   **`skip_then_retry`'s recovery was not only its retries, and the rest of it ran outside the gate
   entirely.** A gate that wraps the parse attempts constrains what happens *inside* one and says
   nothing about recovery work that never enters one — and this combinator's actual recovering is
   the **skip** to a sync point and the **advance** over a sync point that did not admit a parse.
   Both are `Ok`-returning primitives that fold a terminal trip into the value they use for genuine
   exhaustion: `sync_balanced` answers `Ok(None)` whether it found no sync point or the scanner
   tripped mid-skip, and `next` answers `Ok(None)` whether the input ended or the scan tripped. So a
   spent scanner budget read as *"nothing left to skip to"* and the combinator surfaced its ordinary
   trigger error for it — an error whose `is_terminal()` is `false`, which a `PartialSession`'s
   terminal latch reads and nothing else corrects. Through a **rejecting** emitter this never showed,
   because the rejection propagates as an `Err` out of the skip itself; through an **accepting** one
   the diagnostic is filed and the `Ok` comes back looking exactly like end of input.

   Both phases now go through `recovery_gate::recovery_step`, which samples the three input-side
   witnesses across the operation — it reads three rather than five because the other two
   interrogate an error value and a step that returned `Ok` has none — and a stop inside either
   surfaces the terminal-marked `UnexpectedEot` every other committed exit in this crate surfaces
   for a trip an accepting emitter took. *"The scanner stopped"* and *"there was nowhere to sync
   to"* are two different answers again, and only the second is recoverable.

   **Unchanged:** an ordinary failure still recovers, in all four attempts, and a genuine sync
   exhaustion still surfaces the trigger error — the EOF reading is narrowed, not replaced, and a
   cell pins each half of that pair. The verdict is attempt-relative against per-attempt baselines,
   so a stop an *enclosing* lookahead caused before the attempt started is never charged to it.

   **One source-breaking addition, and it is the only public-surface change.**
   `ParseInput for SkipThenRetry` grows
   `Error: From<UnexpectedEot<L::Offset, Lang>>`, because surfacing a terminal stop means
   *constructing* one and that is the carrier this crate constructs. It is the same conversion
   `next_or_stop`, `try_expect_or_stop`, the peek family and both pratt engines already require, and
   one fifth of `FromTokenErrors`, so a grammar that can reach end of input at all already has it; a
   grammar that cannot gets a compile error naming the missing `From`. There was no bound-free
   alternative — `MaybeTerminal` is a *predicate*, with nothing to build from — and the alternative
   of leaving the stop unmarked is the defect. Everything else is internal: `recovery_gate` is a
   private module, `Input::scanner_trips` is a private field, and its two accessors are
   `pub(crate)`.

   **What it costs, stated exactly:** every witness is read on the failure path only, so a
   successful attempt pays just its baselines — one `Option<L::Offset>` clone plus two `usize` loads
   per attempt. For the two speculating combinators the clone is the same value the checkpoint they
   save clones anyway; `inplace_recover`, which saves none, pays it new. The scanner counter's write
   side is one `wrapping_add` on the trip arm of the terminal predicate, which is a path that has
   already decided to stop.

   **Narrowed on purpose, and this is the one behaviour change beyond the headline:** a scanner stop
   latched *anywhere inside* the attempt now re-raises, including when the attempt then fails for an
   ordinary reason short of the boundary — a wide lookahead that trips, followed by a syntax error.
   That is the same rule `parser::many`'s absence exits already apply, and for the same reason: the
   attempt's evidence was truncated by a stop, and recovering from it would re-lex the same prefix
   and re-trip. It fails closed, and the whole existing suite is unaffected by it.

   **What holds it, and what watched it fail.** A new behavioural suite,
   `tokora/tests/recovery_terminal_stop.rs`, 13 cells. The trip cells are self-calibrating, so no
   absolute scan tally has to be maintained: the primary parser records the scan count at the
   instant its own scan tripped, and each cell requires the counter not to have moved since. Five
   direct trip cells (all four attempts, plus the accepting-emitter control that proves the two
   sinks now agree); two **nested-speculation** cells, in which the primary catches the trip inside
   an inner `attempt` of its own, declines it, and then fails ordinarily — driven through both
   `recover` and `inplace_recover`, because the two rollback postures are what would otherwise make
   the defect look like a property of the *outer* attempt when the *inner* rollback is what defeats
   the latch; two **phase** cells for a trip inside the skip and inside the advance; and four
   scoping cells that go red if the gate starts refusing ordinary failures, one of them the genuine
   sync exhaustion paired against the skip-phase trip.

   `RECOVERY_GATE_CENSUS` covers the structure the suite cannot, and it was extended for the reason
   its own shape made it miss the sync phase: it constrained what happens *inside* the chokepoint,
   which is silent about recovery work that never enters one. It now names the **phases**, not just
   the attempts — every step routes through `recovery_step`, each matches both outcomes, and no
   combinator source reaches a recovery primitive on its own handle (`inp.sync_balanced(`,
   `inp.next(` and three siblings pinned absent, which works off the convention that a combinator's
   handle is `inp` and the chokepoint's closure parameter is `input`). The witness scan is now split
   by subject: the two error-carried witnesses appear exactly once, in `judge`; the three
   input-side ones exactly twice, once in each judging body, each ahead of the verdict that body
   carries out.

   Watched failing three times, each with the whole behaviour suite green: with the latch swapped
   for the positional `at_committed_boundary` (a real regression a rollback over the latch defeats);
   with `Recover`'s guard re-spelled by hand, correctly; and — the extension's own demonstration —
   with the scanner counter deleted from `recovery_step`, where the behaviour suite stays 13-for-13
   because the latch reading beside it answers the same way on every case anyone wrote, and the
   census reds on the count. That is the shape the census exists for: a witness redundant on the
   cases in the suite and load-bearing on the ones that are not.

   Two frontiers are stated on it rather than left to be found. It reads two combinator sources plus
   the chokepoint, so a recovery combinator added in a *new file* is not read until it is listed;
   and the ungated-primitive check is a **list**, so a recovery phase built on a primitive nobody
   added is a phase nothing reads.

62. **The collection drivers had the same rollback hole item 61 closed for recovery, and the
   monotone counter it added now closes it here too.** Item 61 said, correctly, that `parser::many`'s
   twelve collection drivers "consult the poison boundary at every absence exit". What it did not
   say is that those drivers were reading it with exactly the defect it was in the middle of fixing
   one module over: the boundary is a lineage memo, and a driver's read of it sits outside every
   rollback the elements below it may perform.

   An element is entitled to open an [`attempt`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/input/struct.InputRef.html#method.attempt)
   of its **own**, meet a scanner resource trip inside it, catch the stop, and decline that attempt.
   The inner restore then rewinds the cursor, the cache, the emissions **and** the poison boundary
   together — back to the value the *driver* snapshotted before its element loop. Every witness the
   drivers had answered `false` afterwards, over a stop that is live, already diagnosed and re-trips
   on the next scan of the same prefix:

   - **34 gates** read clean. The 30 absence exits concluded "no more elements" and returned a
     silently truncated `Ok`; measured, `peek`-free `repeated()` over such an element returns
     `Ok([])` on `"1 2"` under a budget the element spent, indistinguishable from the same parse
     under a budget it did not.
   - the **4** `file_element_failure` swallow sites were worse than a missed re-raise. There the
     element's ordinary `Err` was **filed as a recoverable diagnostic and the loop carried on** — so
     the run also gained a syntax error describing input the scanner never read, and the rollback
     had already erased the trip's own diagnostic, leaving a log that does not mention the stop at
     all.
   - the **8** real-closer gates are unaffected and stay that way, deliberately. A committed
     pre-trip closer settles the scanner question, and the lookahead that latched past that closer
     is the same one that bumped the counter — so a counter reading there would refuse exactly the
     delimited parses the latch reading would, all of which a wider scan window completes to the
     identical value.

   Neither companion witness could have covered it. `at_committed_boundary()` is positional and the
   restore rewinds the cursor too; `tripped_during_attempt` counts *descent* trips, and a scanner
   trip bumps no descent counter.

   The fix is item 61's, reused rather than reinvented: `Input::scanner_trips`, the monotone session
   counter whose sole writer is the crate's terminal predicate, read through
   `scanner_trip_snapshot` / `scanner_tripped_during_attempt` at
   `absence_after_element` and `file_element_failure`. Nothing `pub` changed and no bound moved.

   **Its baseline is per COLLECTION, and that is the opposite of the descent counter's.** The two
   facts decay differently: a descent trip an element caught and legitimately parsed past stops
   being true of the input, so its baseline is re-taken per element; a spent scanner budget does
   not, so its baseline is taken once, above the element loop, beside `latch_snapshot()` whose
   question it answers. Per element it would drop the case *element 1 trips and accepts, element 2
   declines* — element 2's baseline would be taken after element 1's trip and the exit would read
   clean — which is a case the latch beside it has always refused.

   **The latch reading is now fully subsumed, and is kept anyway.** Every transition this crate can
   produce that moves the boundary goes through `latch_if_limit_tripped`, which bumps the counter
   first. Measured rather than argued: with `latched_during_attempt` neutered in place and the
   counter left in the condition, every test binary of `--all-features` passes — including the
   `absence_terminal_stop.rs` cells the latch used to be the sole holder of. It stays for the reason
   the recovery gate's equivalent term stays: it is the reading the boundary itself is the subject
   of, it costs one clone already being paid, and a witness removed on a subsumption argument is a
   witness removed on an argument rather than on a measurement. `file_element_failure`'s positional
   `at_committed_boundary()` is **not** subsumed and is load-bearing — it sees a boundary latched
   before the driver started that the element has now run onto, which no per-collection counter
   baseline can see.

   `GATE_CENSUS` grew the witness and a placement test that is the exact mirror of the descent one:
   the scanner baseline must be taken once per collection and **outside** the element loop, where
   hoisting the descent baseline would itself be the defect. Watched failing with the whole
   behaviour suite green — the extension's own demonstration: with one driver's baseline moved
   inside its loop, `every_driver_baselines_its_scanner_witness_once_per_collection` is the **only**
   failing test in all 105 binaries, because no behaviour cell anyone wrote builds the shape that
   placement drops. Two new regressions pin the behaviour itself, one per gate, each watched failing
   first and each with a widened-limit control that differs in nothing but the scan budget.

63. **A peek that reached the lexer reserved two token windows, not one.** The fill allocated the
   public `Peeked<W>` deque the caller gets back, and then — on the cache-miss path — a second
   `W::CAPACITY`-slot store of the same entry type, a `GenericArray<MaybeUninit<_>, W::CAPACITY>`
   holding the tokens lexed past the cache until the cache region had been copied out. The window
   bound caps the slot *count*, but `Token`, `State` and `Span` are unconstrained in size, so a
   grammar with a large token payload or a large lexer state paid **twice** the window it asked
   for on every peek that reached the lexer. For the crate's own oversized fixture — a 1 KiB token
   beside a 1 KiB lexer state, 2,072 bytes an entry — that is 132,632 bytes at `U32` and 33,176 at
   `U8`; those are now **66,320** and **16,592**. Nothing about the peek's result changes; this is
   stack the caller was paying for and could not see. It matters most where the stack is smallest,
   which is the `no_std` target the crate advertises.

   The second store existed to solve an **ordering** problem, not a storage one. A window's two
   halves are produced in the opposite order from the one it must report: the tokens past the
   cache are lexed *during* the fill, while the cache region is copied out in one bulk read
   *after* it, and `Cache::peek` only appends. That needs the staged region to end up *behind* the
   cache region — not a second array. So it is staged at the tail of the window the caller already
   owns and rotated back once the cache region is in. The rotation permutes values inside the
   deque and copies none out, and the deque owns each staged entry from the moment it is pushed,
   so every exit — success, a withheld frontier, a limit trip, a fatal emit — frees it exactly
   once. `input/input_ref/` now contains no `unsafe` block at all; the two it had were the removed
   array's partial-initialization bookkeeping.

   Reordering the copy *ahead* of the loop would need no rotation and no check, and it is not
   available: `Cache::peek` takes `&'p self` and the entries it appends borrow the cache for the
   whole of the fill, while the loop's every step — `lex_within_boundary`, `classify`,
   `emit_lexer_error_deduped`, `cache_append` — takes `&mut self`, and `cache_append` mutates the
   very cache those entries borrow.

   **The reordering creates one hazard, and it is checked.** `Cache::len` is now load-bearing: the
   fill reserves the window's cache region from it *before* it stages anything, so a `len` that is
   not the resident count mis-sizes the copy that follows. An under-report clips the copy mid-run
   and the rotation then closes the gap with staged tokens that belong *after* the residents the
   clip dropped — not a short window, a **hole**, at a position the next consume will not serve.
   `Cache::len` and `Cache::peek` now say so where an implementor reads them, and the fill exit
   that rotates checks the copy it got, in **every build**: a count identity, and — because an
   inexact `len` can satisfy any count derived from it — the resident run's own `front`/`back`
   endpoints, gated on the staged count, which is a number the fill computes rather than one the
   cache reports. The endpoint witness is the release-critical half, not the optional one: it is
   the only check that sees a clip landing exactly on the window's edge, or a `len` under-reporting
   all the way to **zero**, which passes the count trivially as `0 == 0`. Both of those are the
   hole. `InputRef::peek` grows a `# Panics` section. The two exits that answer from tokens already
   at the front of the stream append nothing behind their copy, so they cannot hole, and they are
   unchanged and unchecked.

   **The hot read pays nothing for it, and that took measuring.** The half of the fill that
   reaches the lexer is now `#[inline(never)]`: staging in the window puts a deque push, a
   truncate, a rotation and a `Cache::peek` whose room is a runtime value into the same body as
   the resident-head arm, and the register allocation and block layout that follow are shared.
   Left in one function, six peek-shaped bench ids paid **1.11×–1.31×** for code they never run —
   and the checks are not what they were paying: with both removed entirely the same six ids
   still read 1.11×–1.31×. Split out, with the overflow-free fill taking its own exit and the
   panic message built out of line, the same six read **0.80×–1.15×**: the two `heavy` ids — a
   large lexer state, exactly the shape the second window cost the most — come back **20%
   faster**, and the worst reading is `input/scan/peek1_then_next` at 1.15×, a drain that defeats
   its own cache by construction so that every read is a fill. Geometric mean across the six,
   0.98×. Nothing outside the peek family moves.

   The same law decided where the release-active endpoint witness lives, and it cost one more
   measurement to find out. Inlined into the fill it sits past the overflow-free `return`,
   unreachable from the arm that takes it — and moved `peek1_then_next` by **1.025×** anyway,
   consistently and outside the noise, for exactly the reason the split above exists. So
   `assert_cache_copy` is `#[inline(never)]` too, and its second message joins the first in a
   `#[cold]` free function. Out of line, the six ids read **0.9987** geometric mean against the
   window fix alone, every one of them inside 0.974×–1.009×, over ten interleaved criterion
   rounds. The 67–70-instruction figure that once argued for keeping the witness in debug builds
   is withdrawn: it was the cost of running the check, and what a hot path actually pays is the
   cost of *stepping over* it.

   Coverage, since the previous overflow tests asserted only `len()`: seven cells pinning window
   order across the cache/overflow boundary — the smallest overflow, a prefilled cache, a cache
   that retains nothing, a parked front token, and the widest window over an oversized token and
   state — which removing the rotation turns red along with the pre-existing
   `token_accessor_reads_owned_arm`; a drop-counted cell for the *keeping* exit; a second phase on
   the fatal-emit cell that reads the buffer back after the failing return; compile-time size
   assertions over the oversized fixture; and a source census that refuses to let the fill body
   name an array, a deque, a `MaybeUninit` or `unsafe` again. The two `should_panic` cells that
   exercise the endpoint witness alone — the under-report by one, and the under-report to zero —
   are ungated and run under `cargo test --release` as well, which is the build the witness was
   promoted for; a `should_panic` whose panic compiles out passes by never running the code it
   names. The drop-safety cells now count into a per-scenario `Rc<Ledger>` instead of `static
   AtomicUsize`: they assert *live* deltas while their own window is still held, so under Rust's
   default parallel test runner they were counting whatever else happened to be running —
   `cargo test overflow_peek` failed 184 runs out of 200. —
   *(#156)*

64. **The peek fill had two paths no benchmark in this repository entered — including the one
   item 63's rotation and its release-active endpoint witness live on — and one bench file kept
   its evidence where nothing could check it.** No library behaviour changes; both halves are
   benchmark-suite defects.

   `InputRef`'s peek fill returns early when the window is already met (`want == 0`, no lexer
   touched) and, on a window wider than the cache, stages the surplus tokens at the tail of the
   caller's own buffer and rotates them in behind the cache region. **Neither path was reachable
   from a single shipped bench id.** Every peek id read width 1 and consumed what it peeked
   before peeking again, so `want` was always 1; and `DefaultCache` is three slots, so nothing
   narrower than a width-4 peek can overflow. That was measured, not argued: with the sites
   instrumented to panic, all 45 ids across `input_scan`, `parser_combinators`, `pratt_typed`,
   `cst` and `backtrack` ran clean. Item 63 disclosed the same gap from the other side — it
   promoted a `Cache`-contract endpoint witness to release-active precisely because a clipped
   copy rotated in behind staged tokens holes the window rather than shortening it, and no
   shipped id reached the rotation that check guards.

   A new `input/peek` group in `tokora/benches/input_scan.rs` adds `r4_peek1_hit8` (a width-3
   peek primes the cache, three width-1 peeks then take the hit exit) and
   `r4_peek8_heavy_staged` (a width-8 peek over the three-slot cache, under the deliberately
   heavy lexer state, so five tokens overflow and the `L::State` clone they pay is a visible
   256-byte copy). Under the same instrumentation `r4_peek8_heavy_staged` trips all three sites
   of the miss path — the staging push, `assert_cache_copy`'s endpoint half, and the
   `rotate_left` itself — `r4_peek1_hit8` trips only the hit exit, and no pre-existing id trips
   any of them. The arithmetic that reaches each exit is also a `const`-gated assertion inside
   the driver itself, run once outside the timing loop, so a probe that stopped reaching its path
   would fail the bench instead of reading as coverage; the existing groups' ids, fixtures and
   baselines are untouched.

   `tokora/benches/pratt_typed.rs` had 758 comment lines carrying measured figures and structural
   claims that nothing could verify — seven review rounds had produced about twenty corrections to
   its prose and none to its code. The structural claims are now assertions that run before either
   entry point registers anything: fixture byte-density counted from the generated bytes rather
   than from the generator's loop, the right/left pair proved equal except at exactly the operator
   positions, the checksum's depth-1 associativity blind spot pinned in both directions, and the
   recursion-budget rationale executed against the deepest fixture instead of argued. Every
   remaining figure moved into one dated, attributed record block that states it is not re-derived
   by anything. That pass found the file already carrying a stale claim — it attributed the parse
   recursion default to `RecursionLimiter::new`, which item 50 of this release returned to 500;
   the 64 in question comes from `ParserContext` and the input layer — plus two source line
   numbers into another file, now symbol names.

65. **Three public claims corrected where they said more than the crate does. Documentation only —
   no behaviour changed, nothing `pub` moved, no test result changed.** Each was already
   contradicted, or already left unstated, by something measured in the tree.

   **The sync family's panic-unwind claim was false at two of its three sites, and one paragraph
   held all three.**
   [`sync_to`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/input/struct.InputRef.html#method.sync_to),
   [`sync_through`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/input/struct.InputRef.html#method.sync_through)
   and
   [`sync_balanced`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/input/struct.InputRef.html#method.sync_balanced)
   carried the same sentence byte for byte: a panic out of the predicate, the expected-tokens
   closure, the lexer or the emitter "settles — this method's `to`-shaped commit posture keeps the
   diagnosed prefix; the rewinding scans (`sync_through`, `sync_balanced`) restore to the call's
   entry instead". The clause names its own two counterexamples in its own next breath. `sync_to`
   commits; `sync_through` **consumes** on a stop, committing at the matching token's own span, and
   **rewinds** at a no-match end of input; `sync_balanced` crosses the axes — it stops before the
   sync token and keeps the skipped prefix like the first, and rewinds at end of input like the
   second, which is why its unwind disposition belongs to the *exit* rather than to the mode. Three
   postures cannot share one true sentence. Each method now states its own, with its own
   measurement: `r9_stop_exit_panic_still_commits_the_diagnosed_prefix` for `sync_to`;
   `sync_through_unwind_restores_emissions` and `sync_through_warm_unwind_prices_its_re_lex` for
   `sync_through`; and the pair
   `r9_balanced_stop_exit_panic_keeps_the_prefix_like_its_own_stop_does` /
   `r9_frontier_commit_interrupted_abandons_rather_than_half_keeping` for `sync_balanced`.
   `sync_balanced`'s paragraph also stops calling its prefix *diagnosed*: that scan makes no
   per-token report at all. The **in-flight token** is stated as the two-case fact it is rather
   than a blanket put-back: the scanner's `TokenSlot` separates a token still *held* — true across
   the predicate and nowhere else, where an unwind returns it to the front of the stream — from one
   already *handed over* to the stop settle, where the put-back is precisely the step the panic
   interrupted and so cannot happen. There the retained stream is cleared instead and the region
   re-lexes from the committed position, which reproduces the token; what is lost is the cache's
   memo of it, not a token. `r9_stop_exit_panic_still_commits_the_diagnosed_prefix` measures that
   handed-over case, and the two rewinding scans reach their keeping arm only on the same side of
   the split. No behaviour changed anywhere; only the sentences were wrong.

   **One clause is genuinely common, and it is the one that was newly needed.** The exclusion
   [`skip_while`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/input/struct.InputRef.html#method.skip_while)'s
   claim was narrowed for — *anywhere but the end-of-input settle* — is a property of the shared
   scan scope, which every mode's end-of-input exit disarms *before* its settle runs, so all four
   carry it. For a committing scan that is where the whole diagnosed prefix goes: the skipped run
   sits in an uncommitted frontier, the unwind drops it, and the position stays at the call's entry
   with the diagnostics already emitted standing over a prefix it no longer covers —
   `eof_commit_interrupted(true)` reads `((0, 0), 0)`, the entry position beside the entry state.
   For the two rewinding scans it costs nothing, because there that settle *is* the restore and the
   scan committed no progress for a dropped frontier to strand; what is at stake is the rest of the
   restore, swept at every `L::Offset` clone by `r9_restore_entry_is_atomic_at_every_offset_clone`.

   **The byte-identity requirement that produced this is retired, and replaced rather than
   dropped.** Requiring the three paragraphs to hash identically was doing real anti-drift work, and
   it could only ever be satisfied by making two of the three wrong. A `POSTURE_CENSUS` in
   `src/input/input_ref/census_tests.rs` takes the work over in three parts: all four sections must
   carry the shared exclusion; the three sync sections must stay pairwise **distinct**, each saying
   it states *this method's own* posture, with none carrying the retired sentence again; and — the
   part that actually looks at behaviour — each section must state the posture its own `ScanMode`
   **has**, its required *and* forbidden phrases derived per method from `HOLDS_ENTRY`,
   `COMMITS_FRONTIER_ON_STOP` and `REPORT_SKIPPED` as they stand in `scan.rs`, over a pin on the
   `ScanScope::keeps_on_unwind` formula those phrases are keyed to. Shared-clause presence and
   distinctness alone would pass three paragraphs that are pairwise different and wrong about all
   three methods; the derived check fails on any permutation of them, and flipping one of the
   constants fails the doc until the prose follows it. Prose is compared with `///` stripped and
   whitespace collapsed, so rewrapping a paragraph is not drift. Every check was watched failing
   against the defect it names — each section swapped for another's in turn, and all three rotated
   together for the case only the derived check can catch.

   **Why a *consuming* `Accept` is exempt from every terminality witness — and why a zero-width one
   is not — is now said in public.** Items 48, 61 and 62 finished a programme that put three
   witnesses under the never-recoverable law — the descent counter, the scanner counter for the
   recovery combinators, and the same scanner counter for the collection drivers. The docs said
   where each witness sits; the reason the **accept channel** is exempt from all of them was written
   only in `parser::many`'s module docs, whose `//!` text rustdoc does not render because the module
   is private.
   [`MaybeTerminal`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/error/trait.MaybeTerminal.html) now states
   it where the contract itself is described: every gate under that law sits on a channel where
   *this crate* draws the conclusion — a recoverer synthesizing a value, a driver concluding a
   construct ended from a decline, a stall or a closer — and none of them is consulted when the
   grammar produces the value itself **and consumed input to produce it**. So an element that
   catches a trip, still consumes and returns `ParseAttempt::Accept` spends it, permanently and by
   design: gating that would mean a value-producing parser can never recover from a budget it
   deliberately caught, which is a contract this crate makes for no other error.

   **The exemption stops at a zero-width `Accept`, and the section says so outright rather than
   leaving it to be inferred.** A value returned without consuming anything has produced a value but
   not moved the parse, and the driver's very next act is to read that absence of progress as *no
   more elements* — a conclusion of the driver's own, gated through the same chokepoint a decline
   reaches and by all three witnesses at once. That is not a corner case: the four `*_while`
   collection drivers and the `*_while` folds take their element through `ParseInput`, which has no
   decline channel at all, so a zero-width return **is** their decline — which is exactly the
   hole item 58 closed for the descent witness and item 62 for the scanner one. Publishing the
   exemption
   without its boundary would have restated, as a contract, the shape two shipped fixes had just
   removed. The "answered versus swallowed" framing does not settle this case by itself, so the
   boundary is drawn on what the return *consumed* instead.
   [`RecursionLimitReached`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/error/struct.RecursionLimitReached.html),
   which stated the exemption for its own stop only, now points at the general statement and carries
   the same limit on it.

   **`Emitter::rewind`'s "report before you mutate" rider now says what it does not buy.** The rider
   requires a detecting emitter to raise its unpaired-settle report from a preflight over unchanged
   state, so a host that catches it holds the emitter it had rather than a half-rewound one — and it
   stopped there, which invites reading the whole operation as recoverable. It is not:
   [`rewind`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/emitter/trait.Emitter.html#method.rewind) is
   called from the middle of a checkpoint restore, below the point where the lineage has been popped
   through the target and any session points above it released, and above the point where the
   position, the error-reporting witnesses and the cache-push counter are installed. A compliant
   preflight makes the *emitter* transactional and cannot make the *restore* so; a host that catches
   the report must treat the parse as over rather than resume on that handle. The tear itself was
   already measured — `restore_unchecked_is_not_transactional_across_the_settle_wall` — and already
   stated on
   [`InputRef::restore`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/input/struct.InputRef.html#method.restore),
   but only there, behind the `unstable-raw` feature, where a consumer of the recording CST `Sink`
   never reads it. The bound now sits on the always-compiled trait contract that grants the panic
   door in the first place.

67. **Three corrections to the `Cache` trait's own contract, and the conformance kit made
   falsifiable against two of the three.** A third-party implementor has only the trait docs to
   go on, and two of its load-bearing sentences said something the law stated elsewhere in the
   same doc comment contradicted.

   **`peek`'s bound was corrected from the buffer's total capacity to what it has left.** The
   trait's contract bullet and `peek`'s own `# Parameters` note both said `peek` appends
   `min(len(), buffer capacity)`; `peek`'s `# The law` section, in the same doc comment, already
   said *remaining* capacity. A `peek` written to the wrong half of that contradiction — reading
   `buf.capacity()` where it should read `buf.remaining_capacity()` — computes the same bound as a
   conforming one whenever `buf` arrives empty, and a different one as soon as the caller hands it
   a buffer already holding a parked token or staged overflow, which is the shape `InputRef`'s own
   peek fill produces on the paths that reach this call. Whether that wrong bound is ever *visible*
   is a separate question, and the answer is the uneven coverage described below: an implementation
   that clobbers or reorders what `buf` already holds leaves a trace and is caught, while one that
   simply drops the surplus leaves none. All three summaries now agree: the bound
   is `buf`'s **remaining** capacity *at call time*, and `peek` appends *behind* whatever `buf`
   already holds, never over it.

   **`Cache::len`'s panic clause is qualified to the fill path that reaches the lexer.** It read
   as an unconditional "the fill checks the copy it gets and panics"; the check only ever runs on
   the path that reaches the lexer, matching what `InputRef::peek`'s own `# Panics` already
   scoped it to. The trait doc now says so too, instead of promising a check the cache-hit exit
   never performs.

   **A law that was only implied is now stated outright: a push is refused only when the cache is
   full, on both arms, not just `push_back`'s.** `push_front`'s own doc said "if the cache is
   full, returns `Err`," which reads as one licence among possibly others; it is the only one.
   The trait's contract bullet, `push_front`'s own doc and `RETAINS_FRONT`'s doc all say so now:
   declaring `RETAINS_FRONT = false` buys back the input layer's parked-slot fallback, it is not
   a licence to refuse a `push_front` into an empty, non-full cache.

   The conformance kit is what changed underneath all three, though not evenly, and the uneven
   part is worth stating rather than rounding off. The refusal law it now enforces outright. The
   `peek` bound it enforces only where a violation is *observable*: a `peek` that clobbers or
   misorders what `buf` already holds is caught, at every residency and every prefill depth, but a
   silent total-capacity `peek` — one that computes the wrong bound and drops the surplus without
   trace — is **provably invisible** from outside, because a full `ArrayDeque::push_back`
   returns the value and leaves the deque untouched, and `min(min(len, W), R)` equals `min(len, R)`
   for every width and prefill. That one is not rejected; it is *pinned*, by a test asserting the
   kit accepts it, which fails the day the blind spot closes. And `len`'s panic clause the kit
   cannot reach at all, for a structural reason rather than a hard one: the check runs inside
   `InputRef`'s peek fill, and the kit drives a `Cache`'s own methods directly without ever
   building an input to reach that fill through — the panic is perfectly catchable, the kit
   catches twenty of them, what is missing is the call path.
   `tokora::conformance::cache` now
   drives `peek` at every residency and every buffer-prefill depth instead of one fixed shape,
   and drives the empty-cache refusal law at every nonzero capacity regardless of what
   `RETAINS_FRONT` declares — so a `Cache` certified with `CacheHarness` after this change
   carries a materially stronger guarantee than one certified before it. The kit's module docs
   also gained a section naming what it still does not check; the sharpest entry in it belongs to
   the same audience as the three corrections above: every oracle in the kit compares **spans
   only** — never the token or the `L::State` beside it in the same `CachedToken` — so a cache
   that returns the right spans while corrupting either one still passes in full.

### Performance

The materialization walk was one linear pass **plus a from-zero coverage rescan per gap**,
which is Θ(n²) in the number of diagnosed gaps. As 0.8.0 ships it is a **single** pass that is
linear in events — one walk against a monotone run cursor, with the coverage verdict settled
after the walk rather than before it — **plus one `k log k` ordering of the `k` recorded
diagnostic spans.** With one lexer error per token `k` is Θ(events), so materialization is
**O(n log n)**, not linear; the quadratic term is what this round removes.

This round first replaced the rescan with a *gather* pass in front of the walk, and item 51
below then folded that gather into the walk. Every figure here was originally taken on that
intermediate two-pass shape, so all of it has been **remeasured against what ships** — and one
of them changed sign. Each bullet is the shipped `finish` against the pre-round rescan shape
at `548fd9a`, which is the baseline the superseded figures were against too, with the two-pass
reading kept beside it so the fold's own share stays visible.

A distribution sort that would make it genuinely linear was implemented and **rejected on
measurement**: a fixed four-pass radix costs 15n against a 9n budget at every size, an
adaptive one steps between one and two passes across the probe range and reports growth
indistinguishable from real nonlinearity, and both pay ~1024 fixed operations per `finish` in
the common case where a parse records a handful of diagnostics. Those two readings are the one
thing here that is *not* remeasured — the candidate was never merged, so there is nothing left
to run — and the `9n` they are scored against is the pre-round bound `3 × (events + gap
tiles)`, from before the sort was charged its own `k log k`. The rejection stands as a decision
of that date, not as a measurement of what ships. It remains a candidate with its own
measurement.

- `finish_error_dense` — **17.4× faster** (4 096 alternating error/token pairs; 2 406 µs →
  138.0 µs). The two-pass shape read 15.9×, which is the figure this section carried before.
  A growth probe pins the shape rather than the constant: the in-suite replay-work instrument
  reads **1 299 / 5 999 / 27 199** units at n = 100 / 400 / 1 600 against its bound of
  1 600 / 7 200 / 32 000, growth **4.62× / 4.53×** for a 4× input. The 799 / 3 199 / 12 799
  against 900 / 3 600 / 14 400 at a flat **4.00×** published here before is withdrawn twice
  over: 4.00× was an artifact of charging the sort a flat element count, which made the
  charged quantity linear by construction and left the growth clause unable to fail for the
  reason it existed, and the payload predates the fold besides. A reading above 4.00× is the
  correct one — it is the sort's `k log k` becoming visible to its own gate, which is this
  section's **O(n log n)** being met rather than contradicted.
- `finish_wrap_heavy` — **3.90× faster** (2 048 retro-wrap targets; 160.4 µs → 41.1 µs). The
  two-pass shape read 3.62×.
- `finish_clean` — **8.7% faster** (74.1 µs → 67.7 µs over 8 192 tokens), where this section
  said *18% slower, and this ships*. It is the harness's designated no-regression control, and
  measured on what ships it does not regress: the gather pass was the cost, and folding it into
  the walk gives back **17.8%** against the two-pass shape — more than the regression it was
  disclosed for. What is *not* settled is the constant. The regression this replaces moved
  between +12.4% and +22.8% across the nine alignment residues of a padding sweep, and this
  remeasurement is one residue on one toolchain; composing the two puts the shipped walk
  between ~8% faster and within a point of parity across that whole band. So the 18% is gone
  at every residue the sweep covers, and the 8.7% is not a constant to lean on. `finish`'s
  internals are private, so a sharper figure can land in a patch release without breaking
  anyone.

  Method, and it is the one the scan-path table below uses. Four `[profile.bench]` builds off
  one shared `Cargo.lock`, so criterion and every other dependency is identical and only
  tokora's own source differs: the shipped tree twice in separate target directories, the
  two-pass shape at `868eb0c`, and the pre-round shape at `548fd9a`. `benches/cst.rs` is
  byte-identical across the first three. It did not exist at `548fd9a`, so that arm runs the
  shipped bench under three mechanical API adaptations and nothing else — `Sink::new` arity,
  `finish` taking the source, `cst_finish` arity — and what qualifies it is that it reproduces
  the two published two-pass ratios independently, at 15.96× and 3.57× against 15.9× and 3.62×.
  Arms were interleaved within each of sixteen rounds rather than run in blocks: 32 shipped
  runs per id against 16 two-pass and 12 pre-round. **The null control is 0.12–0.28% with no
  excursion** — the two shipped builds are byte-identical, same SHA-256 — and the smallest
  delta above clears its own control by 31×, with no population overlapping any other. This was
  **not** a quiet machine and nothing here depends on it having been one: the same M4 Pro at a
  1-minute load average of 2.5–5.0 across 14 cores, unrelated work resident throughout.

  — *(R8, #123; figures remeasured against the shipped fold)*

- A nested rollback is **linear in lineage depth** rather than quadratic.
- **The release-level scan path regresses on `next_drain`: +2.7% against 0.7.3.** The leading
  suspect, not an established cause, is the ownership that closes item 9: the benched path lexes
  with no peek, so there is no stream slot to borrow the token from, and tracking each handover
  separately — which is what makes the unwind edge correct — is state the scan must carry, and
  could not be relocated even if confirmed. It stays a suspect because nothing isolates it:
  `ScanScope` is what makes the unwind edge correct, so there is no build with it reverted to
  difference against, and the figure below is the release-level delta, 0.7.3 → 0.8.0 over 54
  commits, not item 9 alone. That absence of an isolating build is exactly why the attribution
  stops at suspicion rather than cause.

  What is measured and solid is code size: the `input_scan` bench closure grows **+560 bytes
  against 0.7.3**. An earlier draft of this entry also cited a 356-byte
  `drop_glue::<ScanScope>` symbol as evidence; that citation is withdrawn. `skip_trivia_next` is
  the only bench in this file that ever touched `ScanScope`, and item 54 below (#154) took the
  complete-input trivia skip off the shared scanner: no scan scope is built on that path any
  more, so there is nothing left to link, let alone size. `nm` confirms zero occurrences under
  `[profile.bench]` as shipped, under that profile with LTO disabled, and under an unoptimized
  debug build alike. No build configuration reproduces the symbol, so the figure is dropped
  rather than requalified. Two mitigations were tried and both reverted on measurement —
  outlining the whole `Drop` as cold made a second bench worse.

  The wall-clock figure earlier revisions of this round left owed is measured, and the whole
  `input/scan` group is given rather than the one id, because the group does not move together:

  | `input/scan` id     | 0.7.3    | 0.8.0    | change       | null control | separation       |
  |---------------------|----------|----------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
  | `next_drain`        | 333.1 µs | 342.1 µs | **+2.7%**    | 0.08%        | disjoint         |
  | `try_expect_hits`   | 216.3 µs | 219.1 µs | inside noise | 0.63%        | inside the floor |
  | `peek1_then_next`   | 530.4 µs | 527.9 µs | inside noise | 1.55%        | inside the floor |
  | `skip_trivia_next`  | 338.9 µs | 279.3 µs | **−17.6%**   | 0.25%        | disjoint         |
  | `try_expect_misses` | 523.2 µs | 427.5 µs | **−18.3%**   | 0.02%        | disjoint         |

  Two `[profile.bench]` builds — `468f7aa` (0.7.3) and this release — resolved from one shared
  `Cargo.lock`, so every dependency version including criterion is identical and only tokora's
  own source differs. The drivers and the `synthetic_source` fixture are byte-identical at both
  revisions. Arms were interleaved within each round rather than run in blocks, across three
  campaigns: 28 runs per id on 0.8.0 against 14 on 0.7.3 for the first three, 12 against 6 for
  the rest.

  **The noise floor is 0.6%, with one excursion to 1.55%**, and it was established before any
  delta was believed: a null control of two builds of *identical* source in separate target
  directories — which came out byte-identical, same SHA-256 — carried through every campaign as
  a third arm. Its two halves differ by 0.02–0.63% on five of the six ids. On the sixth they
  differ by 1.55%, because a single run of `peek1_then_next` returned 622.8 µs against a ~525 µs
  population. That is a machine event, and it is why nothing here under ~1.5% is called a
  result. `next_drain`'s +2.7% is 34× its own control, the two populations do not overlap at
  all, and it reproduced independently at +2.8% and +2.5% in two campaigns.

  This was **not** a quiet machine and nothing above depends on it having been one: an M4 Pro at
  a 1-minute load average of 2.7–4.8 across 14 cores, with unrelated work resident throughout.
  Interleaving plus the null control is what makes that survivable, since drift lands on all
  three arms alike — and the one event that did occur is the 1.55% row rather than something
  folded into an average.

  Two limits on reading it. The first is stated where the attribution is made, above: the
  figure is release-level, not item 9 in isolation, and a narrower attribution is a patch
  release's job for the same reason `finish_clean`'s residual above is. The second: earlier
  revisions disclosed **+1.5% on `skip_trivia_next`** and then withheld it as stale; withholding
  it was right for a stronger reason than staleness, because against 0.7.3 that figure is
  **wrong in sign**. #154 took the trivia skip off the shared scanner after item 9 landed, and
  the id is now 17.6% *faster*. `failed_sync_through_over_8`, offered here before as the
  counterweight at 1.4–2.5%, comes back inside noise against 0.7.3 on this harness, so it is
  withdrawn as one. The counterweight that survives measurement is `try_expect_misses`, at
  −18.3%.

51. **`Sink::finish` replays the event log once instead of twice.** Materialization used to make
   a full gather pass over every event before the walk that drives the builder: it validated
   kinds and retro-wrap targets, collected the recorded lexer-error spans, and read the
   uncovered runs off the token spans so the walk could tile a run at the token it trails. All
   three now happen inside the walk.

   The canaries move to the arm of the event they were already about. The error spans are still
   merged into a **set** and the coverage verdict is still order-independent — it is simply
   decided after the walk instead of before it, which it can be because
   [`UncoveredGap`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/cst/enum.FinishError.html) was only
   ever consumed at the end. The run lookahead is now a *monotone cursor*: a run's tile is armed
   at the token that opens it and forced at the next builder-visible event, which resolves its
   far end by scanning forward to the next token — never rescanning, and skipping outright every
   region whose run the following token resolves for free.

   Measured on a 57.7 KB GraphQL document (64,085 events): **1,727 µs → 1,663 µs, −64 µs**,
   with the produced tree byte-identical across the clean, perturbed, hand-broken and
   every-prefix corpora.

   **One behaviour changes, and only on a malformed stream: error precedence.** Two passes meant
   every gather-class refusal (`ReservedKind`, `StaleStartAt`, `DanglingForwardParent`,
   `InvalidDiagnosticSpan`, `InvalidDialectKind`) outranked every walk-class refusal
   (`OrphanFinish`, `ImproperWrap`, `MismatchedFinish`, `OverlappingSpans`, `SpanOutOfBounds`,
   `OffsetOverflow`) whatever their buffer indices. One pass reports the **first violation in
   buffer order**. No stream that was refused is now accepted, and none that was accepted is now
   refused; a stream with two defects may name the other one. Within a single event the order is
   unchanged — each fused arm runs its gather checks ahead of its walk checks.

52. **A `Sink` reserves its event log at construction, from the source's length.** The log used
   to grow from empty, doubling about sixteen times over a 57.7 KB document and copying roughly
   4 MiB in the process. `Sink::new` now asks for the capacity that doubling would have arrived
   at — the source's byte length rounded up to a power of two, capped at 65,536 events (2 MiB) —
   so the same final block is bought once.

   The predictor is sound only because a sink is compile-time restricted to trivia-surfacing
   lexers: every source byte reaches it as a token or a reported lexer error, so the event count
   tracks the byte count (0.80–1.11 events per byte across this crate's corpora). The **cap** is
   what keeps that from being a liability for a grammar whose tokens are long — past it the byte
   count stops being evidence and the `Vec` resumes doubling — and the **rounding** is what keeps
   the reservation from backfiring: reserving the raw length under-reserves a lossless log, which
   buys a large eager allocation *and* a double-sized reallocation on top, and measured slower
   than reserving nothing at all. An empty source still allocates nothing.

   Measured on the same 57.7 KB document, paired over fourteen rounds: **−5 µs (σ 8)**. The
   allocation count and the ~4 MiB of copying go regardless of what the wall clock on one
   allocator says.


53. **A `trace`-feature preview no longer costs the entire remaining source, every time.**
 `InputRef`'s per-event source preview (`trace_preview`, behind the `trace` feature) built
 `format!("{rest:?}")` over the *whole* remaining source — potentially the entire input, at
 every instrumented combinator call (`peek`, `begin`/`commit`/`rollback`, `try_expect`,
 several per token) — then walked that string a second time to count it, just to keep the
 first 24 characters. Θ(remaining input) per event, unconditionally, made Θ(n²) over a parse:
 benchmarking with `--all-features` (which enables `trace`) against a ~128 KiB fixture wrote
 133 MB of stderr in 5 minutes without finishing the cheapest bench cell's warm-up.

 A bounded `fmt::Write` sink now aborts the `Debug` call as soon as it has enough output to
 answer the 24-character window and the ellipsis, so the preview never walks more of the
 remaining source than a `Debug` impl's own internal batching forces. Measured against this
 crate's own `input_scan` bench fixture shape (newline-delimited, digits and punctuation): a
 single preview at offset 0 goes from 250µs to 208ns at 128 KiB and from 10.5ms to 958ns at
 8 MiB; a full traced parse over that shape scales linearly in token count on both sides of
 the fix, at a per-token cost that no longer grows with how much input is left.

 That bound is conditional, not universal: it holds for a `Debug` impl that writes
 incrementally, and it does not hold for one that front-loads its entire output before its
 first write. Every `Source`/`Slice` pairing this crate ships was checked against that line;
 the guarantee is asserted for exactly these, not for `Source` in general.

 A third shape is not narrow at all, and is the only one of the three reachable from outside
 this crate. `Source`'s `Slice` associated type is public and implementable downstream, and
 `Slice`'s own bound (`PartialEq + Eq + Debug`) puts no streaming requirement on its `Debug`
 impl. A conforming impl may scan, escape and allocate its *entire* remaining slice into a
 temporary and call `write_str` once; this sink cannot shorten work that already ran before
 it was ever invoked, so the cost stays exactly the `O(remaining source)` this fix exists to
 remove. Output is still correct even here — the window and the ellipsis decision come from a
 genuine prefix of the untruncated dump no matter how it was produced — so this is a cost
 gap, not a correctness one, but it is the most severe of the three: unbounded, not merely
 narrower, and reachable with an ordinary trait implementation, no unsafe or misuse of this
 crate required. No in-tree backing does this today; `bounded_debug`'s doc comment and its
 `bounded_debug_is_correct_but_unbounded_for_a_front_loading_debug_impl` test carry a fixture
 that exercises exactly this shape.

 The other two remain narrower and **found, not fixed**: a `[u8]`-shaped backing (`[u8]`,
 `HipByt`, the `smol-bytes` byte types) bounds its allocation and escaping work but still
 iterates every remaining element, because `Formatter::debug_list` drives its iterator to
 completion independently of write failures; and a `str`-shaped backing (`str`, `HipStr`,
 `Utf8Bytes`) still costs `O(run)` for a run of characters with nothing escape-worthy in it,
 because `Debug for str` accumulates such a run before its first write. Realistic text —
 which breaks such runs at newlines, quotes, etc. — is unaffected, but a contrived input like
 this crate's own `int_run_source`/`comma_list_source` bench fixtures (digits and spaces for
 ~128 KiB at a stretch) is not; `bytes::Bytes` and `bstr::BStr` have neither gap, since both
 hand-write their `Debug` loop with `?` on every write.

 Output is unchanged: every trace line reads identically to before this fix, character for
 character, ellipsis included — checked against a spread of inputs (empty, short, exactly at
 the 24-character boundary, far longer, and content that escapes heavily: newlines, tabs,
 both quote characters, backslashes, non-ASCII, and a multi-byte scalar straddling the cut).

54. **The trivia skip no longer goes through the shared scanner on a complete input.**
   [`skip_while`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/input/struct.InputRef.html#method.skip_while) —
   the primitive behind the `padded` combinators, and the door every lossless grammar opens at
   every decision point — now runs its own two-phase loop under
   [`Complete`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/input/struct.Complete.html): a token already
   at the front of the stream is judged **where it lies** and consumed there, and only once the
   stream is empty does it reach the lexer. No scan scope is built, no frontier pair is cloned,
   and a token already resident is never taken out and put back to be judged. The lexing phase
   does keep one thing the scope carried, and entry 59 above is that.

   **Measured against the previous release line: 7.4% off a whole GraphQL parse** (1600.2 µs →
   1482.5 µs on a 57 kB document; 159.0 µs → 148.1 µs, 6.9%, on a 7.5 kB one). Minimum over nine
   blocks with `apollo-parser` as an unchanged control, builds interleaved within each repetition,
   five repetitions, contended repetitions discarded. That figure is **net of** the unwind guard in
   entry 59 above, which is the honest number for this release because the guard ships with the
   route: without it the same measurement reads 17.4% and 15.9%. An earlier draft of this entry
   claimed 25%; that did not describe this measurement even before the guard existed, and it is
   replaced rather than adjusted.

   **No caller-visible behaviour changes**, and the guarantee is the one already documented on the
   method: for a caller whose input-layer callbacks are inert and whose predicate answers from the
   values it is handed, the parse result, the tokens read next, the resume cursor, the committed
   span and lexer state, the diagnostics, the poison boundary, the dedup watermark and the
   predicate call sequence are all identical. What the route runs *internally* differs: it clamps
   the committed position once per skipped token where the scan clamped once per call, and it asks
   the cache for its front where the scan popped and pushed back.

   Two things it had to re-establish, both pinned by new cells in `fast_path_tests`. A resource
   trip inside a skip latches the poison boundary at the **committed cursor** rather than at the
   scanner's deferred frontier, and those are the same offset because the route commits every
   token as it crosses it. And a panic mid-skip leaves the input whole: a call interrupted at its
   `k`-th predicate consumes exactly the `k − 1` tokens the predicate accepted and every other
   token stays reachable. The two phases reach that differently, and entry 59 above is what makes
   the second half true — the resident phase runs the fallible half of each settle while the token
   is still in the stream and so needs nothing, while the lexing phase holds the token it lexed
   across the predicate and owes a put-back. One consequence is visible only to a host that catches
   an unwind: an interrupted end-of-input commit now keeps the prefix the call had already crossed
   (span and state describing the same token) where the scanner discarded it.

   A [`Partial`](https://docs.rs/tokora/latest/tokora/input/struct.Partial.html) input keeps the
   shared scanner, whose scope owns the five-fact `Incomplete` restore and the emitter mark a
   streaming skip needs settled on every exit. The split is by typestate and is guarded by a
   differential sweep: a *sealed* partial input takes every decision a complete one takes, so the
   two routes are held to the same observation over the same programs, sources and cache
   capacities.

   **That parity claim excludes exactly one exit, and the exclusion is deliberate**: an unwind
   *inside the end-of-input settle* — the consequence the paragraph before last already names, seen
   from the other side. Both routes finish a skip that ran to end of input the same way — read `Lexer::span`,
   take `Lexer::into_state`, write the pair — but the scanner reaches that settle having already
   disarmed its scan scope, so the frontier holding the whole skipped run is dropped with the
   unwind, while this route committed each token as it crossed it and keeps them. The complete
   input's answer is the better one: both routes told `Emitter::commit_token` that the run's tokens
   were consumed, and only this one's committed position agrees with what it said. Every callback
   that can raise that unwind — the lexer, the source, the span, the offset — is one the method's
   own precondition already requires to be inert, so the narrowed claim costs a caller who meets
   the condition nothing. Nothing wider diverges: a panic out of the predicate, out of
   `Emitter::commit_token`, out of the emitter's diagnostic path, out of `Lexer::lex`, or out of
   `Lexer::span` anywhere but the settle leaves the two routes identical, as does every run in
   which nothing unwinds. The difference is pinned — as a difference, with both columns asserted —
   by `the_two_completeness_routes_are_pinned_apart_on_an_interrupted_eof_settle`.

### What CI enforces now that it did not at 0.7.3

A reader deciding whether to upgrade trusts gates, not adjectives. Every one of these was
added because something got through the previous set.

- **The changelog has a structural check.** It is the one load-bearing release artifact no
  compiler, linter or test reads, and it had already failed in production: a rebase resolved it
  as a verbatim union — textually correct, no conflict markers — and silently ate a heading,
  filing six breaking changes under `### Performance` while every gate passed. The check runs
  in seconds with no toolchain and is a merge-blocker, not advisory.
- **The `no_std` tiers execute.** The previous job *built* the crate without `std`, which never
  compiles a test target — so nothing `no_std`-shaped had ever run. Enabling it found a failure
  that predated the change and that no gate could have seen. That configuration now runs
  **its tests where it ran none**, and the CAS-less backing is checked on a real CAS-less
  target.
- **The compile-time diagnostic rails assert they ran.** The trybuild harness pins its
  `.stderr` files to the MSRV toolchain and returns early on any other rustc — passing, having
  compiled nothing. A skip was indistinguishable from a pass. It now reports an executed-case
  count, the CI step asserts the count rather than the exit status, and a separate check
  compares the case directory against the harness's registry by exact set equality, because a
  floor cannot detect a missing member.
- **The docs are built without default features, not only with all of them.** An all-features
  doc build documents every item, so a link to a feature-gated target always resolves there —
  it is structurally incapable of seeing a broken link in a smaller configuration. The bare
  build had never run, and it was failing outright with 39 unresolved links. Acceptance is the
  exit status, not a diagnostic count: rustdoc aborts early, so a count is a floor and a floor
  cannot detect a missing member.
- **The per-version logos legs actually exercise the adapter.** The `logos parity (0.14, 0.15)`
  matrix job existed, but the crate's 79 adapter integration files were gated on a feature that
  implies 0.16, so they were invisible to it — a green gate over an untested configuration.
  Those gates now name all three versions, and the same job exercises the adapter on each.
- **A guide-only change is no longer un-gated.** The guide chapters are Markdown compiled as
  doctests, so a blanket `**.md` path filter meant a guide-only pull request landed with zero
  CI.
- **The public API is diffed mechanically against the last published version.** Recall-shaped
  sources — pull-request bodies, commit messages, surface greps — are structurally blind to
  bound additions and to derived-`Debug` movement, and in this release two of those three
  sources turned out not to exist at all for the earliest rounds. The mechanical diff found two
  breaking changes that would otherwise have shipped undisclosed. Advisory-red, because it
  rides rustdoc-JSON on a pinned nightly and can redden without the crate changing.
- **Runtime parity across the three supported logos majors.** The crate advertises 0.14, 0.15
  and 0.16, and until now the per-version matrix only ever *clippy-checked* them — no test had
  executed against 0.14 or 0.15 once. The first run of these cells was red, on a dead-code
  failure that predates this round: an odometer module gated on `std` whose only readers are
  gated on `logos`, so a `std, logos_0_N` test build had two unused functions and
  `#![deny(warnings)]` refused it. **That is the second never-executed configuration this round
  found broken on arrival**, after the `no_std` one. Both now run and pass. *(The adapter's own
  test module is still hard-coded to 0.16, so those adapter-level tests remain single-version.
  That gap is real, named, and not closed here.)*
- **The deep fuzz sweep runs per pull request.** Seeds `0..50_000`, `#[ignore]`d since it was
  written and never run anywhere. It was expected to need a monthly cadence; measured, it costs
  **0.10s in release** (0.85s in debug — the ratio is what says it is doing the work), so the
  whole cost is a build this job has already paid.
- **Miri covers the `unstable-raw` surface.** The raw twins are the surface two rounds
  reordered around capture windows — precisely the unsafe-adjacent shape Miri exists to see —
  and no configuration Miri interpreted before this release enabled them. The second pass runs
  the lib unit tests *and* the whole integration suite again under `logos,unstable-raw`; both
  Miri matrices are sharded by test target, so that cost is spread across shards rather than
  serialised into one cell.
- **The sanitizer script has a caller.** `ci/sanitizer.sh` existed, worked, and was referenced
  by no job — so it had never run on any branch of this campaign. That is the same class as a
  configuration CI compiles and never executes, one level up: not a gate that covers nothing, a
  gate that nothing invokes. ASan and TSan are now one matrix cell each, and the target moved
  from a constant inside the script to an argument the workflow passes, because which
  sanitizers exist is a property of the target.
- **Every public name this release adds is probed against its real owner.** One byte-identical
  consumer is compiled against the merge base and against the branch, over an inventory
  generated from both sides' rustdoc JSON rather than hand-listed, and the gate fails on the
  outcome no diagnostic reports: both sides compile, neither warns, and the witness disagrees.
  What CI does **not** do is build a real downstream crate. A job that cloned one at a pinned
  ref was written for this release and removed before it shipped — it never ran on a push or a
  pull request, and `continue-on-error` kept it from failing the build on the schedules where
  it did run — so a source-level break that only an independent consumer can witness is caught
  by that consumer's own CI, not here.

### Streaming CST is not in this release

`PartialSession::parse` now requires `Ctx::Emitter: ValueKeyedEmitter`, which makes pairing a
session with a recording `Sink` **uncompilable**. This is a deliberate scope decision with a
return path, not an omission.

The reason is that the *sound* way to use the pairing was never enforceable. A session redrives
each attempt from the base, so a threaded sink accumulates the replayed prefix; the correct
usage is a fresh sink per attempt, and **no type can observe freshness.** The choice was
therefore between shipping a combination documented as unsound and shipping a bound that makes
it unrepresentable. The bound also states something the crate already believed: `Sink`
deliberately does not implement `ValueKeyedEmitter`, on the stated ground that a sink cannot
wrap a sink.

**Diagnostics-only streaming is unaffected** — `Fatal`, `Verbose`, `Silent`, `Ignored` and
`&mut` of each all satisfy the bound, and a compile-time control pins that so a future
tightening cannot take streaming diagnostics with it unnoticed. Everything else in the
streaming lifecycle ships: the budget, the committed frontier, the terminal latch, the
refusal-coherence law.

**What returns with the witness:** the chunked-session-equals-one-shot guarantee, and the
supported fresh-sink-per-attempt story.

**The bound closes the session route only.** A hand-rolled refill loop that calls
`parse_partial` directly with a shared recording sink produces the same duplication — measured,
not inferred. `parse_partial` is unchanged: it predates this release, and a *single* call with
a sink is perfectly sound, so bounding it would forbid working code rather than only broken
code. If you hand-roll a redrive loop, build a fresh sink per attempt.

— *(R8, #123)*

### Known limitation — a parse and the emitter serving it share no identity (one witness closed, one open)

Nothing in the `Emitter` or `ParseContext` contract lets an emitter learn which parse it is
serving: `Cursor` carries an offset and a `PhantomData`, and `commit_token` carries a token and
a span. R8 filed this as an invariant with **two** witnesses and said the fix was *"one contract
with two additions"*. **One of the two landed in this same release; the other did not**, so the
statement is rewritten witness by witness rather than left describing a tree that no longer
exists.

**Witness 1 — a sink bound to a foreign source — CLOSED where an inequality is proof.**
`Emitter::bound_source` (defaulted, `None`) lets an emitter declare the source it binds, and the
point at which an emitter is attached to an input compares that against the source the parse
reads. Since #128 that point is the input's **constructor** — where the two are bound for the
input's whole life — so the comparison happens once per input and covers every borrow. A `Sink`
built over `"XY"` and driven over a same-length `"ab"` now **panics at the parse entry** instead
of materializing a tree whose text is `"XY"` and whose structure came from `"ab"`. Equal length was always the point: no length check caught it, and `finish` never could,
because the event log a wrongly-paired sink produces is byte-identical to one a legal single
parse could produce. The cell that pinned the wrong answer is now
`sink_bound_to_a_foreign_source_is_refused` and asserts the panic.

**The residue, narrowed and stated rather than dropped.** The refusal fires only where
`Source::REFERENT_IS_BYTES` says an unequal reference *proves* an unequal source — the `?Sized`
backings (`str`, `[u8]`, `BStr`), where the reference is the data. For a **sized** backing the
reference addresses a variable rather than the bytes: two `bytes::Bytes` handles cloned from one
`Arc` name the same buffer at two addresses, and refusing them would convert a working program
into a runtime panic. So for the owned handles — and for the `&str` / `&[u8]` reference forms —
the door stays open, exactly as it was. That is the honest price of refusing to break correct
code, and a third party closes it for their own backing by overriding one `const`.

What the check covers is wider than "3 of 13 `Source` impls" suggests, because the population
that matters is *declaring lexers*: every lexer in this tree declares `type Source = str` or
`= [u8]`, and the logos adapter inherits logos' own. **No shipped lexer declares a reference
form.**

**The wrapper hole is NOT closed, and four shapes reach a wrong-buffer tree.** The seam can
only compare an answer it receives, and every route below produces silence or a forged answer
instead:

- **A wrapper that hides `bound_source`.** It forwards every emission and omits that one
   method, so the seam concludes "this emitter binds no source". No bound catches it: a wrapper
   writing `impl CstEmitter for W {}` satisfies `Ctx::Emitter: CstEmitter` while inheriting
   every default, and a provided-method override is invisible to a bound.
- **A parse whose events are all diagnostics.** No token is committed, so nothing token-shaped
   exists to key on, while the lexer diagnostics' spans still license gap tiling over every
   byte.
- **Pre-arming.** `Emitter::bound_source` is a public trait method, and — before
   [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) made the accessor crate-private — `InputRef::emitter()` handed
   parser code `&mut Ctx::Emitter`, so any holder could query the binding. Nothing a sink records
   about "I was asked" can distinguish the parse entry from anyone else.
- **Hand-emitted `cst_token` spans.** The manual emission door carries a span, so a grammar can
   choose which source bytes the tree shows while consuming nothing.

**A finish-time wall against (1) was built during this round and removed before release.** It
caught the naive wrapper and each of (2), (3), (4) was then found to walk around it — every fix
relocated the hole, because the witness was flags on the sink and *the sink cannot tell who set
them*. Shipping a `FinishError` variant that names a protection with three known bypasses is
the same defect as a `## Panics` section promising a panic the code does not perform, and this
release deleted nine of those. All four shapes are pinned by cells asserting today's answer.

**What closes the class is minting the sink from the source, and it landed in this release
instead of 0.9 as first planned.** [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking) ships `cst::parse_lossless` and
`cst::parse_lossless_partial` in place of the `input.sink(inner, profile)` shape sketched here:
the source is named once, in the driver's own argument list, and handed to both the `Sink` it
mints and the `Input` it drives, so the binding is neither hideable nor forgeable because there
is nothing to hide or forge. `Sink::new` is `pub(crate)`, so bullet (1)'s wrapper has no `Sink`
left to build over — which takes bullet (2) with it, since an all-diagnostic parse still needs a
wrapper to hide behind. Bullet (3) closes because the query route it used,
`InputRef::emitter()`, is crate-private now (see that bullet, revised in place). Bullet (4)
closes the way `CstEmitter::cst_token` itself does — deleted, not walled. The returned `Cst`
implements no emitter trait either, so the artefact cannot be re-aimed at a second parse
regardless of which of the four a caller tried. What this leaves open is stated below, where
this section's own "when it lands" sentence used to be.

**Witness 2 — the completeness witness — UNTOUCHED.** `CstEmitter`'s contract still names no
completeness parameter, no attempt and no input, so any holder of the emitter may append events
at any moment and the event log still cannot distinguish the live attempt from an abandoned one.
Every route is an instance of that: the `InputRef` and `ParseState` accessors that stay generic
over completeness — deliberately, because `Partial` legitimately needs them for **diagnostic**
emission — and every combinator that hands either to a user callback. Pinning individual
combinators to `Complete` walls an instance; it cannot wall the class, which is why this stays
contract work rather than a door-by-door patch.

The stale-structure witness — an abandoned attempt's node surviving into a later attempt's tree
— is closed for the session route by the `ValueKeyedEmitter` bound above, and its test was
deleted rather than weakened, because the shape it exercised no longer compiles.

**So R8's sentence still holds, and now reads "one landed, one open".** A *source* identity
could not live on `CstEmitter`, because it would miss `Sink::commit_token` — the path every
ordinary parse uses — which is why it sits on `Emitter` and is checked where an emitter meets an
input. A *completeness* witness on the same contract is what closes witness 2 and what returns
streaming CST.

**The repair landed as [68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking), and two of its three predictions here did
not hold.** This paragraph forecast that minting the sink from the input would close witness 2
at the same time and would be "the mechanism that restores streaming CST". Neither happened:
witness 2 is untouched, exactly as stated above — `CstEmitter` gained no completeness parameter
— and streaming CST is still blocked by the `ValueKeyedEmitter` bound described in *Streaming
CST is not in this release*, above, an axis minting never touches. Both were forecasts about a
mechanism that had not been built yet, made on the assumption that one constructor change would
answer two independent invariants; only the one this section is about turned out to be true.

**Retained, not retired.** The same paragraph promised that landing minting would retire
`Emitter::bound_source` and `Source::REFERENT_IS_BYTES` — *"two mechanisms for one invariant is
how a crate ends up with three."* That assumed a closure that does not hold.
[68](#0.8.0-changed-breaking)'s drivers pin `Sink` into the emitter slot **by name**, but the
value they hand a callback instead of the emitter — `EmitterView`, also new there — implements no
emitter trait only as a fact **about this crate**. Under the orphan rules, a downstream crate
whose own lexer type appears in the parameter list may write
`impl Emitter for EmitterView<'_, '_, ItsLexer, Sink<…>>` and install that over a second, foreign
buffer from inside a callback — a route through a callback parameter, which is exactly what
minting's pinned-slot trick does not reach, because that trick only pins the driver's own entry.
`Emitter::commit_token` is off the view's surface there too, so the route still carries no token,
no span and no byte of the foreign buffer — but it can carry a forged or absent `bound_source`
answer, which is bullet (1) above, one level in. The handshake is what a wrapper on that route
has to forward honestly for the general constructor check to still catch the foreign pairing;
a wrapper that declines to forward
it reports `None` and the seam sees nothing to refuse — the same residual disclosed for every
wrapper since R10. And nothing about `bound_source` names `Sink` or `cst` in the first place: it
is the general `Emitter`/`ParseContext` handshake, so any hand-rolled emitter paired with the
ordinary `parse`/`parse_partial` entry points depends on the same check regardless of CST.
`bound_source`, `REFERENT_IS_BYTES` and `SourceIdentity` earn their place on the route minting
cannot reach, and stay additive infrastructure rather than a stepping stone to their own
retirement.

Refusing any of this at materialization remains **impossible**, not merely expensive: the bad
event logs are byte-identical to logs a legal single parse could produce, so `finish` has
nothing to discriminate on. That is why the check has to sit at the seam or nowhere.

— *(R8, #123; witness 1 narrowed by R10, its construction-time route closed by #168; witness 2
still open)*

### Known limitation — `finish` does not refuse duplicate zero-width token spans

Separate and smaller, listed apart because it is **not** the identity gap: the monotone-span
wall never fires when duplicated spans are both `[0,0)`, so such a log materializes. A
conforming lexer cannot produce one — a token is a span of consumed bytes, and a lexer
returning zero-width tokens without advancing does not terminate — so this is reachable only
through the raw event surface or a third-party `Lexer` that ignores the contract, which is
what the sink's release walls exist for. It pins a property of *materialization*, not of the
parse-to-emitter contract, and it flips when `finish` starts refusing these spans. —

### Known limitation recorded and closed before release — a discarding error sink erased the recursion trip's stop, not its bound

**This limitation was closed before release and does not ship in 0.8.0.** It was recorded when the
recursion budget landed and answered later in the same release by [48](#0.8.0-changed-breaking),
which moved the resource-trip witness off the grammar's error value and onto the input session,
where no `From` the grammar writes can reach it. The heading above originally read as a live
caveat despite this paragraph, so it was rewritten to state the closure directly; the anchor
changed with it, since this file names an anchor for the heading text it sits above, and the
in-document link from item 48 was updated to match. Design documents written while the
limitation was open still cite the old anchor and are outside this file's reach. What follows
is kept as the record of what it was, in the past tense, and not a caveat a 0.8.0 consumer has
to act on.

**What it was.** Item 42's `RecursionLimitReached` is always terminal, and the recovery combinators
decided whether to re-raise by asking the **converted** error — the type the grammar actually
names — for `MaybeTerminal::is_terminal()`. So a grammar whose `From` for it discarded the value,
`()` included, got `false` back and **recovery spent the trip** instead of re-raising it: measured
on one ladder, one limit and one 32-deep input under `skip_then_retry`, the surrounding grammar was
handed back offset **68** — the whole chain and the sync token consumed and committed — where a
delegating error type was handed back **0**. That was the pre-existing `MaybeTerminal` opt-out
reaching a *resource guard* rather than a malformed-input report, and this entry recorded it rather
than answering it: 16 error types under `error::` carry a `From<…> for ()`, 14 of them before this
release, so it read as two more instances of a crate-wide design rather than a new one.

**What it never put at risk — measured, not reasoned, and still true:**

- **The native stack is already back.** `Descent`'s destructor releases every level on the unwind
  that carries the error out, so by the time any recoverer sees the converted value, every frame
  the budget was protecting has returned. On a 200-level trip the recoverer's frame sits **160
  bytes** from the pre-parse baseline in a debug build and **0** in a release one, against descents
  that reached ~1 MiB and ~97 KiB. The guard's stack-safety purpose survives the sink intact.
- **The depth budget is unchanged.** The cell reads back to its pre-parse value, so a recoverer
  that spends a trip and descends again starts from the same depth and meets the same limit.
  Re-tripping is bounded, not compounding.
- **The retries terminate**, on their own zero-progress guards rather than on terminality:
  `skip_then_retry` consumes its sync token per continuing cycle and runs out of sync points, and a
  repetition over a recovering element stalls on the first element that commits nothing.

**How it is answered.** Item 48 carries the full account and the before/now measurements. The short
form: the witness is a monotone counter on the **input session**, bumped by `InputRef::descend`'s
trip arm *before* the grammar's `From` runs, and `recover`, `inplace_recover`, `skip_then_retry`
and the resilient collection loops read it **beside** `MaybeTerminal::is_terminal`. Both error
types now hand the surrounding grammar back offset **0**. A resource bound that an unrelated error
sink can opt out of is not a bound.

**What the answer does not cover, and what is still open.** `NonAssociativeChain` was the control
here and remains inert: it is `is_terminal() == false` to begin with, so recovery spends it through
a delegating type and through `()` alike and the sink decides nothing; what a sink costs there is
only the offset, which is the ordinary price of discarding a payload and not a change of contract.
And the *class* is older than this release and still stands. `UnexpectedEnd` — the type behind
`UnexpectedEot`, `UnexpectedEoLhs` and `UnexpectedEoRhs`, whose terminal values are real driver
output — is the only other type under `error::` that overrides `is_terminal`, it carries a
`From<…> for ()` of its own, and both have shipped since before this campaign. Whether a discarding
sink should be able to erase terminality for a grammar error, as it no longer can for a resource
guard, is a question about `MaybeTerminal` rather than about these two types, and it is still
recorded rather than answered.

### Notes

`#[diagnostic::do_not_recommend]` was evaluated and rejected. It does not change whether the
curated message appears; its only effect is to hide *which* member is missing, which is the
one datum a consumer needs. Measured on 1.87 and on nightly.

— *(W-api-A, #118)*

**`finish_*` unification attempted and stopped, on the close predicate and close-miss slots.**
`parens`/`braces`/`brackets`/`angles` and `delimited::<D>` share their close body already
(`commit_delim_close`); what the four named parsers duplicate is the five slots they fill it
with. Folding them onto the generic path stops on the two slots that ask the same question
through different traits: the named route asks the **token** (`PunctuatorToken`'s
`close_paren() -> Option<Kind>`), the generic route asks the **pair marker**
(`Punctuator::kind()`, which needs `<L::Token as Token>::Kind: From<CloseParen>`). Neither trait
implies the other, so the fold does not compile without adding `Kind: From<OpenX>` and
`Kind: From<CloseX>` to the four public named parsers — measured, four `E0277`s. Unification here
is signature-stable or it does not happen; the two routes stay disclosed, and 0.9 is equally
breaking-capable if the bounds are ever worth taking.

Their agreement is now pinned rather than assumed (`tests/delimited_route_parity.rs`): the close
predicate over every token kind × all four pairs, the close-miss error compared as a value, and a
16-row corpus — 4 pairs × {unclosed-at-EOF, wrong-closer, wrong-opener, nested-unclosed} — parsed
both ways under a recording emitter. **No render deltas: all 16 rows are identical**, diagnostics
and final cursor alike. The suite exists because nothing in the type system ties a token type's
two punctuator declarations together, so a type whose declarations disagreed would send the two
routes to different diagnostics silently.
— *(R11)*

## 0.7.3 (2026-07-24)

### Added

- `FusedDispatchOnKind` now implements `TryParseInput`: a table hit remains lex-once, while a
  table miss or end-of-input returns `ParseAttempt::Decline` without consuming valid input.

## 0.7.2 (2026-07-24)

### Added

- **Fallible projection traits.** `tokora::utils::Downcast<T>` and
  `DowncastRef<T>` provide owned and borrowed `Option<T>` projections for domain
  types without imposing blanket implementations or a concrete conversion model.

### Fixed

- **Wrong opening delimiter at end of input is no longer misreported as end-of-input.** The
  delimited many-drivers (`repeated`, `repeated-while`, `separated`, and `separated-while`
  `…delimited::<D>()`) now report a wrong opening delimiter as the expected-open unexpected-token
  diagnostic carrying that token, even when it is the final token — instead of `UnexpectedEot`.
  The wrong token stays unconsumed, and the diagnostic no longer depends on whether another
  token happens to follow it. `UnexpectedEot` is now reserved for a genuinely empty opener
  position. Fixes issue #85.

## 0.7.0 (2026-07-23)

### Added

- **Lifetime-preserving borrowed sources.** `Source<usize>` is now implemented explicitly for
  `&'data str`, `&'data [u8]`, and (with `bstr_1`) `&'data BStr`. Their associated slices retain
  `'data` even when the source value itself is borrowed for a shorter call.

### Changed (breaking)

- **`Slice<'source>` now guarantees validity for `'source`.** The trait has a
  `+ 'source` supertrait requirement. Canonical implementations live on `str`, `[u8]`, `BStr`,
  and the optional backend value types; a shared-reference blanket implementation forwards
  `&T`, including nested references, without changing the representation or iterator behavior.
  External `Slice` implementations must ensure that the slice value and its represented data
  outlive `'source`.
- **Borrowed backend slices preserve their representation and longest available lifetime.**
  `BStr` sources now yield `&BStr` instead of `&[u8]`. `HipStr<'data>` and `HipByt<'data>`
  sources now yield `HipStr<'data>` and `HipByt<'data>` rather than shortening the associated
  lifetime to the method borrow.
- **`Source` references are intentionally explicit rather than blanket-forwarded.** This avoids
  shortening a lifetime carried by the source through an unrelated outer borrow. Owned backends
  such as `Bytes`, `HipStr`, and the smol-bytes types remain `Source` implementations on their
  owner types; borrowing an owner to call its methods remains unchanged.

### Migration

- Update custom `Slice<'source>` implementations so the implementing type satisfies
  `'source`. Prefer implementing `Slice` on the canonical representation and let the shared
  reference blanket provide `&T`.
- Code that names `<BStr as Source<usize>>::Slice<'a>` as `&'a [u8]` should use `&'a BStr`
  instead; call `AsRef::<[u8]>::as_ref` when a byte slice is specifically required.

## 0.6.2 (2026-07-23)

### Changed

- `Ident`, `Keyword`, and the literal carriers now accept unsized source/data types.
  Borrowed accessors are available for carriers such as `Ident<str>`, `Keyword<str>`, and
  `LitDecimal<str>`; construction and other by-value operations remain limited to sized
  source/data types. Unsized language markers are now supported consistently by generated
  literals, `Ident` recovery, and `IdentList` APIs; the established public generic order is
  unchanged.

## 0.6.1 (2026-07-22)

### Added

- **Method-form delimiter combinators.** Every `ParseInput` parser can now use
  `delimited::<D>()` directly, with `delimited_by_parens`, `delimited_by_braces`,
  `delimited_by_brackets`, and `delimited_by_angles` as named conveniences.
- **Named delimiters for many-builders.** The same delimiter method family is available on
  `Repeated`, `RepeatedWhile`, `Separated`, `SeparatedWhile`, `AtLeast`, `AtMost`, `Bounded`,
  `AllowLeading`, `AllowTrailing`, `RequireLeading`, and `RequireTrailing`. Existing
  repeated/separated `delimited::<D>()` chains remain source-compatible, including nested
  cardinality and separator-policy wrappers.

## 0.6.0 (2026-07-22)

### Changed (breaking)

- **Delimiter-specific `Unclosed` diagnostics.** Delimited shape and many parsers now emit `Unclosed<D, …>` using the delimiter marker directly; built-in shapes use their concrete `Paren`, `Brace`, `Bracket`, or `Angle` tag. Consumer error types should provide the corresponding `From<Unclosed<…>>` conversions.
- **Composable emitter bundle includes unclosed diagnostics.** `ComposableEmitter`, and therefore `ParseCtx`, now includes `UnclosedEmitter`; custom composite emitters must implement it.
- **Built-in delimiter markers are language-neutral.** Bare `Paren`, `Brace`, `Bracket`, and `Angle` work with any parser `Lang`; the marker language no longer has to match the parse language.

## 0.5.1 (2026-07-21)

### Added

- **Full smol-bytes integration** — `Source`, `Slice`, `Equivalent`, and `ToEquivalent`/`IntoEquivalent` impls for all four `smol-bytes` types: `shared::Bytes`, `compact::Bytes`, `Utf8Bytes` (`shared::Utf8Bytes`), and `compact::Utf8Bytes`. `Source`/`Slice` treat the byte types as `u8` sequences and the UTF-8 types as `char` sequences with UTF-8-boundary-aware indexing; `Equivalent` compares all four types via their byte view, mirroring the existing `bytes`/`hipstr` impls; `ToEquivalent`/`IntoEquivalent` convert the byte types from `[u8]`/`&[u8]` and the UTF-8 types from `str`/`&str`. Feature-gated behind `smol_bytes_0_1`.

## 0.5.0 (2026-07-20)

### Added

- **`Source::as_slice`** — returns the entire source as its `Slice` associated type (the same contents as a full-range `slice(..)`). Element-agnostic across `str`, `[u8]`, `Bytes`, `HipStr`/`HipByt`, smol-bytes `shared`/`compact`/`Utf8Bytes`, and `BStr`; owned sources share the whole source via `clone`, borrowed sources return `self`/`as_ref`.

### Changed (breaking)

- `Source::as_slice` is a **required** trait method (no default body): any external `Source` implementor must now provide it. This is the source-breaking change behind the 0.5.0 bump.

## 0.4.0 (2026-07-20)

### Fixed

- **Unterminated delimited many-builders now report the opener as `Unclosed` through the
  emitter instead of silently accepting the input.** A delimited many-builder
  (`item.repeated(…)`, `item.repeated_while(…)`, `item.separated_by_*(…)`, or
  `item.separated_by_*_while(…)` closed with `.delimited::<D>().collect()`) driven over input
  whose closing delimiter never arrives before end-of-input — e.g. `"(1 2"`, `"[1 2"`, `"{1 2"` —
  used to return `Ok` with the elements parsed so far. It now emits an `Unclosed` diagnostic
  carrying the **opener's span** and the delimiter pair's name:
  - under a fail-fast `Fatal` emitter the parse fails with it (via the `From<Unclosed<…>>`
    conversion);
  - under a recovering `Verbose` emitter the diagnostic is recorded and the parse recovers,
    yielding the elements collected so far.

  A wrong token where the closer belongs still reports the existing unexpected-token
  (expected-close) vocabulary. The `separated`+delimited driver — which previously *did* error
  at end-of-input, but with a stale unexpected-token pointing at the last element rather than at
  the opener — now reports `Unclosed` at the opener like the other three drivers.

  The close-status diagnostic is the **primary**: the `separated`/`separated_while` delimited
  drivers emit it **before** the end-state secondaries (`TooFew`, separator policy), so a
  fail-fast emitter fails with `Unclosed` on e.g. `[` under `at_least(1)` or `[1,2,` at
  end-of-input rather than letting the secondary short-circuit it, and a recovering emitter
  records primary-then-secondaries in order. The plain `repeated`/`repeated_while` delimited
  drivers already ordered the close-status diagnostic before their bound checks.

- **The delimited many-builders commit the closer without re-lexing it, fixing a
  blackhole-cache (`ParserContext<_, _, ()>`) double-scan on the success path.** Internal,
  non-breaking. `InputRef::probe_close` used to classify the closer by scanning it and then
  push the scanned token back to the cache for a follow-up `try_expect` to commit; under the
  blackhole cache `()` the push-back is a no-op, so the closer was dropped and the follow-up
  `try_expect` **re-scanned** it. That second scan is observable to a stateful or
  resource-limited lexer — a valid delimited list (e.g. `(a)`) could trip its limiter, or hit
  the "unreachable" recovery path, on otherwise-valid input. `probe_close` now classifies the
  closer without consuming it — carrying the scanned token out by value, or leaving a cached
  closer at the front — and a new by-value commit primitive advances the cursor over it once, at
  the driver's own commit point, with zero re-scans in every cache capacity. Because the probe
  stays cursor-neutral until that commit, the deferred (`separated`/`separated_while`) drivers
  span their elements correctly and an error before the commit leaves the closer available for
  recovery. All four delimited many-builders (`repeated`, `repeated_while`, `separated_by_*`,
  `separated_by_*_while`) adopt it; the `DefaultCache` path is unchanged (it already scanned the
  closer exactly once). This also removes the same latent double-scan from the `Unclosed` fix
  above, which shipped the identical push-back pattern.

- **Unterminated delimited shape parsers now report the opener as `Unclosed` through the
  emitter, matching the many-builders.** The delimited shape parsers (`delimited::<D>`,
  `parens`, `braces`, `brackets`, `angles`, and their `try_` twins) used to raise a plain
  unexpected-token / end-of-input error when the closing delimiter never arrived; they now
  follow the same four-way close-miss law as the delimited many-builders above. End of input
  with the opener still open emits an `Unclosed` diagnostic carrying the **opener's span** and
  the delimiter pair's name (a fail-fast `Fatal` emitter fails with it; a recovering `Verbose`
  emitter records it and recovers, yielding the construct with a closer synthesized at the
  insertion point — a zero-width span); a wrong token where the closer belongs stays the
  existing unexpected-token (expected-close) diagnostic, not `Unclosed`; and a terminal scanner
  stop surfaces the committed form's end-of-input error, adding no `Unclosed`. The `try_` twins
  keep their decline law (absent opener ⇒ `Ok(None)`, zero consumption) and, once the opener is
  committed, report `Unclosed` on an unterminated group — never a silent decline.

### Changed (breaking)

- Added `UnclosedEmitter`, a new atomically-composable emitter sub-trait
  (`tokora::emitter::UnclosedEmitter`) with a single `emit_unclosed` method, implemented by the
  built-in `Fatal`, `Verbose`, `Silent`, and `Ignored` emitters.
- The delimited many-builder `ParseInput`/`Collect` implementations gained two bounds:
  - `Ctx::Emitter: UnclosedEmitter<'inp, L, Lang>` — **a custom emitter must now implement
    `UnclosedEmitter`** to be usable with `.delimited::<D>().collect()`;
  - `<Ctx::Emitter as Emitter<…>>::Error: From<Unclosed<(), L::Span, Lang>>` — **an error type
    used with a delimited many-builder must gain a `From<Unclosed<…>>` arm.**

  Both are source-breaking for consumers whose emitter or error types do not already satisfy the
  new bounds, hence the 0.4.0 (breaking) classification. The delimiter identity travels in the
  `Unclosed`'s name (`CowStr`); the type-level delimiter tag is the erased `()` (the builder
  reborrows the delimiter internally, so a `Delim`-parameterized bound would not unify across the
  builder's own indirection).
- The delimited **shape** parsers (`delimited`/`parens`/`braces`/`brackets`/`angles` and their
  `try_` twins) gained the same two bounds as the many-builders — `Ctx::Emitter:
  UnclosedEmitter<'inp, L, Lang>` and `<Ctx::Emitter as Emitter<…>>::Error: From<Unclosed<(),
  L::Span, Lang>>`. Source-breaking for shape-parser consumers whose emitter or error types do
  not already satisfy them, on the same footing as the many-builder change above.

### Migration

- Add a `From<Unclosed<…>>` arm to any error type used with `.delimited::<D>().collect()`, e.g.
  `impl<D, S, Lang: ?Sized> From<Unclosed<D, S, Lang>> for MyError { … }`. See the `json`
  example's `JsonError::Unclosed` arm for a worked pattern.
- If you use a custom emitter (not `Fatal`/`Verbose`/`Silent`/`Ignored`), implement
  `UnclosedEmitter` for it, mirroring your `FullContainerEmitter` impl: a fail-fast emitter
  converts the `Unclosed` to `Err` via `From`; a recovering emitter records it on its diagnostic
  log and returns `Ok(())`; a dropping emitter returns `Ok(())`.
- The same two migration steps apply to the delimited **shape** parsers (`delimited`/`parens`/
  `braces`/`brackets`/`angles` and their `try_` twins): add a `From<Unclosed<…>>` arm to the
  error type, and implement `UnclosedEmitter` for a custom emitter.
