//! The lineage memos an [`Input`](super::Input) carries so backtracking can rewind an
//! abandoned continuation exactly, gathered behind one guardian — and the **cell taxonomy** that
//! governs every other restorable cell an input owns.
//!
//! # Single-writer taxonomy
//!
//! Every cell an [`Input`](super::Input) or an [`InputRef`](super::InputRef) owns belongs to
//! exactly one of five classes. The class *is* the restore semantics: it decides what a
//! [`restore`](super::InputRef::restore) does to the cell, and it names the cell's single writer.
//! A cell whose behavior does not match its class is a bug, and this taxonomy exists so that
//! adding a cell without deciding which class it is in is not a thing that can happen quietly.
//!
//! - **Ground truth** — the live scanning position and regime the next token is lexed from: the
//!   lexer state, the last-consumed span, the token cache, and the emitter's emission log. The
//!   scan/consume paths are their sole writer. **Restore OVERWRITES them** with the saved values
//!   (the emission log by truncation to the saved mark). These live directly on
//!   [`Input`](super::Input); the layout keeps them packed ahead of this module's memos.
//! - **Lineage memos** — the bookkeeping gathered here, plus the two lineage facts that live on
//!   [`Input`](super::Input) for layout reasons (the poison boundary and the lexer-error dedup
//!   watermark): what a checkpoint must know to rewind an abandoned continuation exactly.
//!   Backtracking (save/restore/commit and the guards) is their sole writer. **Restore PURE-COPIES
//!   them** back to the saved value — with two structural exceptions that are still memos:
//!   the live-checkpoint stack (restore *pops through* the restored id rather than copying a
//!   snapshot) and the pin set (a restore never changes which guards are live).
//! - **Monotone id sources** — the counters that hand out never-reused ids: the checkpoint-id
//!   source and the savepoint sequence. They are memos in spirit but **restore must NOT touch
//!   them**: rewinding a counter would reissue a live id, and an id that can collide is worse than
//!   no id. Distinguished from a *restored* memo like the cache-push counter — which is a fact
//!   *about* the lineage, not an identity source — precisely because their restore semantics are
//!   opposite.
//! - **World facts** — what the *caller* knows about the outside world, and the parse cannot: the
//!   [`Partial`](super::Partial) `is_final` bit. Its sole writer is the driver
//!   ([`Input::seal`](super::Input::seal), which takes `&mut Input`), it is **monotone** (a stream
//!   cannot un-end), and **restore does NOT touch it** — a rollback rewinds the *parse*, not the
//!   *world*. This class is not a loophole in the restore discipline; it is the one place the
//!   discipline must not reach, and it is enforced structurally rather than remembered: an
//!   [`InputRef`](super::InputRef) borrows the [`Input`](super::Input) for its whole life, so the
//!   cell is *unreachable* while any parser, guard, or speculative branch runs. It therefore cannot
//!   change during a handle's life, so no rollback can observe it change, so a
//!   [`Checkpoint`](super::Checkpoint) has nothing to save. Restoring it instead would be the
//!   mirror bug: a rollback across a legitimate seal would un-end an ended stream and the parser
//!   would wait forever for bytes that will never arrive.
//! - **Witness / instrumentation** — cells that do not affect scanning at all, and are therefore
//!   never restored: the debug-only, process-unique cross-input identity a checkpoint is stamped
//!   with (see [`Witness`](super::Witness); its atomic id source keeps it behind the debug +
//!   `target_has_atomic = "ptr"` gate), and the `trace` nesting depth, whose events travel out of
//!   band (stderr) and so cannot be un-emitted by a rewind anyway.
//!
//! This module is the guardian of the lineage memos: the cells are private to it and reachable
//! only through the operations below, each of which carries the invariant it maintains. Every
//! memo but the cache-push counter is a live-checkpoint concept that only exists where an
//! allocator does, so all of them except [`cache_pushes`](Lineage::cache_pushes) sit behind the
//! allocator gate; an allocator-less build keeps only the counter and every stack operation
//! compiles out.
//!
//! # CELL_CENSUS — every mutable cell, and its class
//!
//! This is the contract, and it is greppable: `grep CELL_CENSUS` finds it from anywhere in the
//! tree. **A new scan-affecting mutable cell on [`Input`](super::Input),
//! [`InputRef`](super::InputRef), [`Session`](super::Session), or [`Lineage`] MUST be added to this
//! table and classified above.** [`census`] is the tripwire that makes that structural rather than
//! advisory: it destructures both structs exhaustively — no `..` — so a new field is a **compile
//! error, right here, in the guardian**, at the table that asks what class it is in.
//!

//! | `poison_boundary` (sticky terminal frontier) | `Input` | lineage memo | pure-copy the saved value |
//! | [`cache_pushes`](Lineage::cache_pushes) | `Lineage` | lineage memo | pure-copy the saved value |
//! | [`live_ckpts`](Lineage) | `Lineage` | lineage memo | pop through the restored id |
//! | [`pinned`](Lineage) | `Lineage` | lineage memo | nothing (a restore does not change which guards are live) |
//! | `points` (open session points) | `Session` | lineage memo | nothing (a rewind *below* an open point is refused by its pin) |
//! | [`next_ckp_id`](Lineage) | `Lineage` | monotone id source | **nothing** — rewinding would reissue a live id |
//! | [`savepoint_seq`](Lineage) | `Lineage` | monotone id source | **nothing** — same |
//! | `finality` (`is_final`) | `Input` (snapshot on `InputRef`) | **world fact** | **nothing** — and it cannot change while a handle lives |
//! | `witness` (input identity) | `Input` | witness | nothing (identity is fixed for the input's life) |
