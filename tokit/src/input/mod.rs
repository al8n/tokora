//! The input layer: [`InputRef`], its backtracking guards, and the completeness typestate.
//!
//! # Partial input (Sans-I/O mode)
//!
//! An input carries a [`Completeness`] typestate. The default, [`Complete`], is the whole source —
//! today's behaviour, with identical generated code. [`Partial`] is a **prefix of a stream that may
//! still grow**, carrying a runtime `is_final` flag the **driver** states — through
//! [`parse_partial`]'s `is_final` argument — when the last chunk lands. While a partial input is
//! non-final, three conservative *frontier rules* at the scan chokepoint keep a construct that
//! later input could still extend from being mistaken for a finished one — each surfaces an
//! [`Incomplete`](crate::error::Incomplete) instead of yielding, emitting, or reporting end of
//! input (see [`InputRef::next`]).
//!
//! ## Finality belongs to the driver, and it only ever goes one way
//!
//! `is_final` is a fact about the **world** — *the caller has told us no more bytes are coming* —
//! not a fact about the parse. Two laws follow, and both are structural rather than advisory:
//!
//! - **A stream cannot un-end.** The bit is monotone: the internal `Input::seal` raises it and
//!   nothing lowers it. No rollback restores it, because none can: it cannot change while a parse
//!   is running.
//! - **A parser cannot end a stream.** Only the owner of the byte buffer can know the stream ended;
//!   a combinator cannot possibly know it. So the sole writer is `Input::seal`, which takes
//!   `&mut Input` — and an [`InputRef`] borrows that input for its whole life. The borrow checker
//!   therefore forbids sealing while *any* handle is alive, which is to say: while any parser,
//!   guard, attempt, or speculative branch is running. There is no `set_final` on an [`InputRef`],
//!   and that absence is the law (see [`InputRef::is_final`], which carries the compile-fail proof).
//!
//! The second law is what keeps finality out of the rollback set safely. Because it cannot change
//! during a handle's life, no rollback within that life can observe it change — so a
//! [`Checkpoint`](crate::input::Checkpoint) has nothing to save, and a restore has nothing to undo.
//! Checkpointing it would be the mirror bug: a driver seals when the last chunk lands, the parse
//! rolls back to a checkpoint taken earlier, finality reverts to `false`, and the parser waits
//! forever for bytes that will never arrive. Rollback rewinds the parse; it does not rewind the
//! world. The crate-internal `input::lineage` module carries the full cell taxonomy this sits in
//! (grep `CELL_CENSUS`).
//!
//! ## One-token frontier latency
//!
//! The holdback withholds a token whose span reaches the buffer end, so **the last token becomes
//! visible only after more input arrives or the input is marked final**. This one-token latency is
//! correct by construction: a token abutting the end could be the prefix of a longer one (`ab` may
//! become `abc`), and the only proof it will not is more bytes — or `is_final`. With `is_final`
//! set, or on a [`Complete`] input, the rules are inert and the last token yields immediately.
//!
//! ## Terminal beats incomplete, and they never substitute
//!
//! Two verdicts stop a scan, and they mean **opposite** things:
//!
//! - an [`Incomplete`](crate::error::Incomplete) means *"more input may fix this"* — the caller
//!   refills and re-drives;
//! - a **terminal** condition — a resource-limit trip ([`Lexer::check`](crate::Lexer::check) failing
//!   after a token) and the poison boundary it latches — means *"no amount of input will fix this"*
//!   — the caller must stop.
//!
//! They are mutually exclusive, and **the terminal one wins**. Nothing in this crate may disguise a
//! terminal condition as an `Incomplete`: the limit is probed, and latched, *before* the frontier
//! rules are consulted, so only a **non-terminal** item is ever withheld. A limit trip fires — its
//! diagnostic emitted, its poison boundary latched — even when the tripping token ends exactly on
//! the buffer end.
//!
//! The ranking is total because the two conditions are facts about different things. A frontier
//! *item* is **provisional**: whether those bytes are a token or a lexer error depends on bytes that
//! have not arrived, so withholding it is the conservative answer, and a truncated buffer really can
//! make a valid token look like a lex error. A limit trip is not about the item at all — it is a
//! fact about the lexer's accumulated tally, which is **monotone**: re-lexing the same prefix
//! re-trips, and appending bytes can only add to it. No refill can clear it, so answering
//! "incomplete" would be answering with a falsehood — and a costly one. A caller parsing untrusted
//! input would refill, retry, and refill again, re-lexing an ever-growing buffer while the limit
//! that exists to bound exactly that work **never fires**; an attacker who aligns a payload to the
//! chunk boundary (a token that keeps growing keeps ending at it) would bypass the recursion and
//! token limits outright. That is the denial-of-service the ranking forecloses, in the one mode —
//! network and protocol parsing — that exists to face it.
//!
//! This is the **dual** of the [never-recoverable
//! law](crate::error::Incomplete#the-never-recoverable-law), and the pair is one rule read from both
//! ends: recovery may not swallow an `Incomplete` (an unfinished construct is not a malformed one),
//! and the frontier may not swallow a terminal condition (a tripped limit is not an unfinished
//! construct). Neither verdict may be spent as the other.
//!
//! ## No growable source; the caller owns the buffer
//!
//! tokit deliberately has **no growable internal source**. An [`InputRef`] borrows one immutable
//! slice for its whole life, which is what makes zero-copy slices, checkpoints, and rollback a
//! snapshot-copy rather than a journalled edit. Resumption therefore lives with the caller: it owns
//! the byte buffer, and on an incomplete result it appends the next chunk to *its own* buffer and
//! rebuilds the input over the larger slice. Re-lexing the whole prefix each round is cheap and
//! keeps the frontier rules a pure function of the current slice.
//!
//! ## The Sans-I/O resumption loop
//!
//! Each attempt parses under a rollback-on-drop [`Transaction`], so an incomplete attempt unwinds
//! its emissions and cursor before the retry; [`parse_partial`] wires this up and hands the closure
//! a [`Partial`] [`InputRef`]. The only requirement partial mode adds is that the emitter error
//! implement `From<Incomplete<L::Offset>>`.

/// A zero-copy token stream adapter that bridges Logos and Chumsky.
///
/// `Input` is the core integration layer between [Logos](https://github.com/maciejhirsz/logos)
/// lexical analysis and [Chumsky](https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky) parser combinators.
/// It efficiently wraps a Logos token source and implements all necessary Chumsky input traits,
/// allowing you to use Chumsky parsers directly on Logos tokens.
///
/// # Zero-Copy Design
///
/// `Input` doesn't allocate or copy tokens. Instead, it maintains a cursor position
/// and calls Logos on-demand as the parser consumes tokens. This makes it efficient for
/// large inputs and streaming scenarios.
///
/// # State Management
///
/// For stateful lexers (those with non-`()` `Extras`), `Input` maintains the lexer
/// state and passes it through token-by-token. This allows for context-sensitive lexing
/// patterns. Because the adapter clones `Extras` each time it polls Logos, it is best to
/// keep your state `Copy` or otherwise cheap to clone. If you need heavy state, consider
/// storing handles (e.g. `Arc`) inside `Extras` so clones stay inexpensive.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `'inp`: The lifetime of the input source
/// - `T`: The token type implementing [`Token<'inp>`]
///
/// # Implemented Traits
///
/// This type implements all core Chumsky input traits:
/// - [`Input`](chumsky::input::Input) - Basic input stream functionality
/// - [`ValueInput`](chumsky::input::ValueInput) - Token-by-token consumption
/// - [`SliceInput`](chumsky::input::SliceInput) - Slice extraction from source
/// - [`ExactSizeInput`](chumsky::input::ExactSizeInput) - Known input length
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Basic Usage
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use tokit::{Token, Input, TokenExt};
/// use logos::Logos;
/// use chumsky::prelude::*;
///
/// #[derive(Logos, Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq)]
/// #[logos(skip r"[ \t\n]+")]
/// enum MyTokens {
///     #[regex(r"[0-9]+")]
///     Number,

  ///   claim that it did. Sealing twice is a no-op; sealing a [`Complete`] input is a no-op (it is
  ///   final by definition).
  /// - **Driver-only.** It takes `&mut Input` — and an [`InputRef`] mutably borrows the `Input` for
  ///   its whole life. So a driver may seal only when **no handle is alive**, and therefore never
  ///   while a parser, a guard, an attempt, or any speculative branch is running. The borrow
  ///   checker, not a convention, is what keeps a combinator from asserting a fact about the world
  ///   that only the owner of the byte buffer can know.
  ///
  /// Together they put finality *outside the rollback set by construction*: it cannot change during
  /// a handle's life, so no rollback within that life can observe it change, so a [`Checkpoint`]
  /// has nothing to save and a restore has nothing to undo.
  ///
  /// A driver that already knows the finality at construction says so through
  /// [`parse_partial`]'s `is_final` argument, which routes here. A driver holding a live input
  /// across chunks (the in-place two-phase shape: drain non-final, learn the socket closed, drain
