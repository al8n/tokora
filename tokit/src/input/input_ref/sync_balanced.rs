  /// Depth counting is **token-level**, which leans on a lexer-contract clause: a composite

  /// least one token reports the whole region exactly once through
  /// [`Emitter::emit_skipped_region`](crate::Emitter::emit_skipped_region), with the hole's
  /// span and count; a zero-skip success (the sync point was the very next token) emits
  /// nothing. Genuine lexer errors crossed while skipping are still emitted (deduplicated)
  /// along the way, and they are not counted into `skipped` — the count covers valid tokens
  /// only. A fatal emitter rejection mid-skip follows the sync family's fatal-exit

  /// [`sync_through`](Self::sync_through).

  /// # Diagnostics travel with progress

  /// A match commits the skipped prefix — the cursor stops before the sync token — and its
  /// hole diagnostic persists; the emission is rewind-safe by construction, because a skip is
  /// committed forward progress and an enclosing rollback unwinds the emission with the log
  /// like any other entry. A resource-limit trip mid-skip commits the skipped prefix at the
  /// durable frontier and returns `Ok(None)` — committed progress, but a failed sync, so **no
  /// hole diagnostic** is emitted for it. A no-match run to end of input commits nothing and
  /// returns `Ok(None)`, leaving no trace: the cursor stays at the pre-call position, the
  /// emissions made during the failed scan (the lexer errors it crossed) are unwound, and the
  /// lexer-error deduplication watermark is restored, so a later genuine consume of the same
  /// region reports its errors exactly once. One diagnostic per hole means **no diagnostic
  /// for a failed hole**. As in [`sync_through`](Self::sync_through), this holds even when
