/// A saved position in the token stream, together with everything needed to resume
/// from it: the cursor, the last-consumed span, the lexer state, the emitter's
/// emission mark, the lexer-error deduplication watermark, and the poison boundary.
///
/// A checkpoint is a snapshot of one **lineage**: the concrete history of tokens
/// lexed and diagnostics emitted up to the moment of the save. Restoring makes that
/// history the live one again. Because diagnostics roll back by truncation (see
/// [`Emitter::rewind`](crate::emitter::Emitter::rewind)), only positions on the
/// *current* lineage can be returned to — which gives checkpoints a stack discipline.
///
/// # Validity
///
/// - A checkpoint is valid from the moment [`save`](crate::InputRef::save) returns it
///   until either **it** is restored ([`restore`](crate::InputRef::restore) consumes
///   it), or an **older** checkpoint is restored.
/// - Restoring a checkpoint **invalidates every checkpoint saved after it**: their
///   lineage — the diagnostics emitted and the tokens lexed after the older save —
///   has been rolled back, and a truncated emission log cannot be rebuilt. There is
///   no correct state such a restore could produce.
/// - Checkpoints are single-use, cannot be cloned, and must be restored into the same
///   input that created them.
///
/// Restores that follow this discipline are exact: the token stream, the retained
/// diagnostics, the exactly-once lexer-error guarantee, and the poison boundary all
/// replay precisely as they stood at save time.
///
/// In debug builds [`restore`](crate::InputRef::restore) verifies the discipline and
/// panics on violation; see its documentation for release behavior. Prefer
/// [`attempt`](crate::InputRef::attempt) (and
/// [`try_attempt`](crate::InputRef::try_attempt)), which manage the save/restore pair
/// structurally and cannot violate the discipline.

  /// predates the emission checkpoint), so restoring the watermark to the cursor
  /// would drop it below the retained error and let a re-lex emit it a second

  /// move together: a speculative peek that trips the limit latches the frontier,
  /// emits the limit diagnostic, and lifts the watermark in one step, and
  /// [`restore`](crate::InputRef::restore) copies all three back to their saved values
  /// together. Under the last-in, first-out restore contract a saved `Some(off)`'s
  /// diagnostic predates the saved emitter mark, so it survives the emitter rewind and
