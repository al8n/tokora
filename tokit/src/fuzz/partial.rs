//! The **partial-input** driver: fuzzes the `Partial` completeness typestate — the driver's seal,
//! the frontier holdback, and the `Incomplete` channel — via chunked equivalence, the same law the
//! conformance kit's `run_partial` checks, but over fuzzed (error-bearing) streams and randomized
//! cuts rather than an exhaustive sweep.
//!
//! Three shapes are checked against the single-shot complete parse (the oracle):
//!
//! - **In-place two-phase.** One `Partial` input over the whole source: a non-final drain yields
//!   every token strictly before the buffer end and ends `Incomplete` (the frontier withholds the
//!   last token / trailing error); the driver then **seals** it and drains on, reproducing the rest.
//!   The concatenation must equal the complete parse.
//! - **Seal survives rollback.** A sealed stream, put through every rollback shape the crate has —
//!   `attempt`, `try_attempt`, explicit and drop-path transaction rollback, a stacked savepoint, a
//!   session point — is *still sealed* afterwards, and drains to genuine end of input rather than
//!   asking for a refill that can never come. This is the law that forecloses the mirror bug (see
//!   below).
//! - **Chunked prefixes.** For random cut points `k`, a non-final drain of `src[..k]` yields exactly
//!   the complete tokens whose span ends strictly before `k` and always ends `Incomplete`.
//!
//! # What the harness can and cannot express about finality
//!
//! It cannot express "a speculative branch flips finality and rolls back", and that is the point:
//! finality is a **world fact**, so it is settable only through the owning input
//! ([`Input::seal`](crate::input::Input::seal), monotone), which an `InputRef` mutably borrows for
//! its whole life. There is no method on a handle, at any depth, in any speculative branch, that
//! could flip it — so there is no such operation to fuzz, and the leak it used to cause is
//! *unrepresentable* rather than merely untriggered. What remains fuzzable is the mirror half — a
//! rollback must not un-*end* a stream — and `seal_survives_rollback` is exactly that oracle.
//!
//! This is error-agnostic (it compares committed token streams, which skip lexer errors
//! identically in both modes), so — unlike the consume driver — the fuzzed streams here **do**
//! contain lexer-error bytes, exercising the error-skipping and dedup paths under truncation.
//!
//! # The third shape: a limit trip AT the cut (terminal beats incomplete)
//!
//! The two shapes above fuzz what the frontier rules *withhold*. The third fuzzes what they must
//! **not** withhold. Under a token limiter ([`ScriptState::with_limit`]) the `(limit + 1)`-th token
//! is reported as a lexer error carrying that token's span — so choosing the cut `k` at that span's
//! end puts a **terminal** condition exactly on the non-final frontier, the alignment an attacker
//! picks. The oracle is the [law](crate::input#terminal-beats-incomplete-and-they-never-substitute):
//!
//! - a prefix that **contains** the trip terminates on the trip — tokens up to it, the limit
//!   diagnostic emitted — and never on the `Incomplete` channel, *including* when the tripping token
//!   ends exactly at the cut;
//! - a prefix that does **not** contain the trip still ends `Incomplete`, so the narrowing did not
//!   turn the holdback off.
//!
//! Every trip-bearing case forces `k` to the trip's span end alongside its random cuts, so the
//! boundary alignment is covered on every such seed rather than waited for.
//!
//! # Fuzz coverage (`OP_SURFACE_CENSUS`)
//!
//! This adds **oracles**, not operations: they drive [`Op::Next`] and [`Op::Seal`], both already in
//! the alphabet and already marked here. The alphabet's size is unchanged, so `EXPECTED_OP_COUNT`
//! does not move (grep `OP_SURFACE_CENSUS`).
