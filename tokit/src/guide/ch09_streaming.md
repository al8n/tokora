Chapter 9: partial input — parsing a stream you have not finished receiving.

Every parse so far started with the whole source in hand. A network socket does not work that
way: bytes arrive in chunks, and a parser that must wait for the last one is a parser that
cannot stream. But the naive fix is a bug factory. Given the bytes `1 + 2`, is the final token
the integer `2`? Or is it the first digit of `23`, whose second digit is still in flight? A
parser that guesses will, sooner or later, guess wrong.

tokit's answer is to make the *question* representable, in the type system.

# The `Completeness` typestate

An input carries a [`Completeness`](crate::Completeness) parameter:

- [`Complete`](crate::Complete) — the default, and what chapters 1-8 have been using without
  ever saying so. The source is all of it. Every frontier rule below is written
  `if Cmpl::PARTIAL && …`, so under `Complete` they are compiled *out of existence*: the
  typestate is not a runtime mode, and the fast path pays exactly nothing for the existence of
  the slow one.
- [`Partial`](crate::Partial) — the source is a **prefix of a stream that may still grow**. It
  carries one runtime bit, `is_final`, that the **driver** states when the last chunk lands —
  [`parse_partial`](crate::parse_partial)'s `is_final` argument.

# The three frontier rules

While a partial input is **non-final**, three conservative rules fire at the scan chokepoint,
each surfacing an [`Incomplete`](crate::error::Incomplete) rather than committing to an answer
that later bytes could contradict:

1. **The holdback.** A token whose span touches the end of the buffer is *withheld* — it might
   be the prefix of a longer one.
2. **A lexer error at the frontier** is withheld the same way: garbage that abuts the end of
   the buffer might be the beginning of something valid.
3. **End of input, when the input is not final,** is not end of input. It is a request for more
   bytes.

Rule 1 is the one you feel, and it has a name: **one-token frontier latency**. The last token
of a non-final buffer becomes visible only when more input arrives *or* `is_final` is set.
That is not a limitation to be engineered around — it is the only sound answer. The sole proof
that `2` is not the start of `23` is another byte, or a promise that there will not be one.

# `is_final` belongs to the driver, and it only goes one way

Notice who makes that promise. `is_final` is not a fact about the *parse* — it is a fact about the
**world**: *the caller has told us no more bytes are coming.* A parser combinator cannot possibly
know it. Only the code holding the socket can.

So there is no `set_final` on an [`InputRef`](crate::InputRef), and there never will be. You state
finality where you build the input — `parse_partial`'s `is_final` argument — and the parser you hand
the input to simply cannot reach it. That is enforced by the borrow checker, not by convention: the
flag lives on the input, the handle borrows the input, and the borrow lasts as long as the handle
does.

Two bugs fall out of that one line, and it is worth seeing both, because they are mirrors:

- **A parser that could end a stream** would break the holdback. Speculate, call `set_final(true)`,
  fail, roll back — and the rollback would not undo it, because rolling back the *world* is not a
  thing rollback does. The next read would then hand you a token the frontier owed an `Incomplete`
  for: the very `2`-that-might-be-`23` this chapter is about.
- **A rollback that could un-end a stream** — the "obvious" fix of checkpointing the flag and
  restoring it — is worse. Your last chunk lands, you mark the stream final, the parser rolls back
  across that moment, and `is_final` quietly reverts to `false`. Now the parser asks for a refill
  that can never come, and your program waits forever. That trades a wrong token for a hang.

The way out is to notice that the two bugs share a premise — that a parser can touch the bit at all.
Take that away and both are gone: finality is set by the driver, before any parser exists, and it is
**monotone** (a stream cannot un-end). Nothing to roll back, and nothing that would want to.

# No growable source: the caller owns the buffer

tokit has **no internal growable source**, and that is a deliberate architectural line, not an
omission. An [`InputRef`](crate::InputRef) borrows one immutable slice for its whole life —
which is precisely what makes zero-copy slices free, and makes a checkpoint a snapshot copy
rather than a journalled edit. Backtracking is cheap *because* the source cannot move under it.

So resumption lives with the caller. It owns the byte buffer; on an incomplete result it
appends the next chunk to *its own* buffer and rebuilds the input over the larger slice.
Re-lexing the prefix each round is cheap, and it keeps the frontier rules a pure function of
the current slice — which is what "Sans-I/O" means: tokit never reads, never waits, never owns
a socket. It parses what you hand it and tells you when it needs more.

[`parse_partial`](crate::parse_partial) wires up one round of that loop: it builds a
[`Partial`](crate::Partial) input over your slice, seals it if this is the last chunk, and hands your
parser an [`InputRef`](crate::InputRef). Partial mode adds exactly **one** requirement to your code —
the emitter's error type must implement `From<Incomplete<L::Offset>>`, so the frontier has a
way to speak. Give it a variant and it is done.

# The bigger example

The [`input`](crate::input) module documents [the Sans-I/O resumption
loop](crate::input#the-sans-io-resumption-loop) end to end, with a hand-written lexer instead
of a logos one — worth reading once, because it shows the frontier rules interacting with a
`lex`/`bump` implementation you can see all of.

# Why chapter 8 came first

Recall the never-recoverable law: an [`Incomplete`](crate::error::Incomplete) is re-raised
untouched by every recovery combinator, checked *before* any skip. Now you can see what it
buys. Recovery skips input on the theory that the input is **wrong**. At a stream frontier the
input is not wrong — it is merely **unfinished**, and skipping it would silently discard bytes
that had not arrived yet, turning a refill request into data loss. The two features compose
only because that law holds: a streaming parser can use recovery, and recovery will never eat
the frontier.

Calc is complete. It lexes, parses, dispatches, computes expressions, speculates, reports,
recovers, and streams. One question remains, and it is the one that decides whether any of it
is true: how do you *test* it? Next: [chapter 10](super::ch10_testing).
