/// A deterministic dispatch combinator driven by a **static table** of viable
/// first-token kinds.
///
/// `DispatchOnKind` is the *kind-keyed* sibling of [`PeekThenChoice`](super::PeekThenChoice):
/// instead of a hand-written handler closure, it takes a `&'static` slice of token
/// [`Kind`](Token::Kind)s — one per branch, **in branch order** — and dispatches on the
/// kind of the next token:
///
/// 1. **Peek** the next token (a single, non-consuming lookahead).
/// 2. **Look up** its kind in the table.
/// 3. On a hit, run the branch at that table index (via [`ParseChoice`]).
/// 4. On a miss — a **committed dispatch failure** — return an [`UnexpectedToken`]
///    whose expected set is *the entire table* (`expected one of …`), reported as
///    [`Expected::OneOf`](crate::utils::Expected::OneOf).
/// 5. On end-of-input at the dispatch point, return an [`UnexpectedEot`].
///
/// # Why the expected set is trustworthy
///
/// The viable first-token set is known **statically** — it is exactly the table. Because the
/// lookahead is non-consuming and nothing speculative runs, a dispatch failure is *committed*:
/// the returned error can never be unwound and lost. This is the intended source of
/// `expected one of …` diagnostics — a static dispatch table, never speculative branch merging.
///
/// # Table ↔ branch correspondence
///
/// The table is indexed **by branch**: `table[i]` is the viable first-token kind for branch `i`.
/// For a tuple of `K` parsers (whose [`ParseChoice::Id`] is [`Branch<K-1>`](Branch)) the table
/// should hold exactly `K` kinds. A branch may of course be reached by only one kind; to route
/// several kinds to the same branch, repeat that branch's kind at each relevant position is *not*
/// supported here — use [`PeekThenChoice`](super::PeekThenChoice) for many-to-one dispatch.
///
/// # Error channel
///
/// The dispatch failure travels the **`Err` channel**: the `UnexpectedToken` (carrying the full
/// expected set) is returned as `Err`, not routed through a bespoke emitter method. Both a
/// fail-fast [`Fatal`](crate::emitter::Fatal) emitter and an error-collecting
/// [`Verbose`](crate::emitter::Verbose) emitter therefore observe the identical payload.
///
/// # The fused twin
///
/// [`FusedDispatchOnKind`] is the *lex-once* sibling: instead of peeking the decision token
/// (a token-cache round trip, including a lexer-state clone) and letting the winning branch
/// consume it again, it lexes once and hands the already-consumed head token to the winning
/// arm. Failures are observationally identical to this combinator's; only the hot hit path
/// differs. Pick per dispatch site: sum-type hot loops prefer the fused shape, while
/// branches that are self-contained [`ParseInput`] parsers (reused elsewhere, or wanting
/// the token left on the input) keep this peek shape.
///
/// # Performance: keep token-kind discriminants dense
///
/// Dispatch cost is one peek plus one table lookup, then the branch. For the *kind match*
/// inside branch parsers — and for any hand-written `match tok.kind()` beside a dispatch
/// table — declare the [`Kind`](Token::Kind) enum with **dense discriminants** (the default
/// `0, 1, 2, …`; avoid sparse explicit values): rustc lowers a match over a dense fieldless
/// enum to a real jump table or lookup, while sparse discriminants degrade to compare
/// chains. The same advice applies to [`FusedDispatchOnKind`], which shares this
/// table-order contract.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```ignore
/// use tokit::{Branch, ParseChoice, parser::{Any, ParseInput}};
///
/// // Dispatch on the first token: number → B0, `+` → B1, `(` → B2.
/// let mut parser = (
///     Any::new().map(|_| "number"),
///     Any::new().map(|_| "plus"),
///     Any::new().map(|_| "paren"),
/// )
///     .dispatch_on_kind(&[TokenKind::Number, TokenKind::Plus, TokenKind::LParen]);
///
/// // On an unexpected first token the error carries `expected one of:
/// // 'number', '+', '('` — lifted straight from the table.
/// let _ = parser.parse_input(inp);
/// ```
