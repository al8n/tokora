//! The partial-input sentinel: the [`Incomplete`] marker error and the [`MaybeIncomplete`]
//! discrimination trait that enforces its never-recoverable law.

/// The partial-input sentinel — signals that the input ended *mid-construct*.
///
/// `Incomplete` is the marker a partial/streaming parse raises when it runs out of input while a
/// construct is still open (a half-read token, an unterminated list): "there may be more input;
/// come back with it". It is defined now so the error family is coherent before the partial-input
/// wave wires it — the type is always compiled but inert until then.
///
/// # The never-recoverable law
///
/// An `Incomplete` is **never recoverable**, and this is a hard contract, not a heuristic:
///
/// - **Recovery combinators must re-raise it untouched.** A recoverer exists to synthesize a value
///   from a *malformed* construct; an incomplete one is not malformed, only unfinished, so
///   recovering it would fabricate a value from input that has not arrived.
///   [`Recover`](crate::parser::Recover) (and the skip-retry driver when it lands) therefore
///   re-raises an `Incomplete` on the `Err` channel instead of invoking the recoverer — see
///   [`MaybeIncomplete`].
/// - **It must never be emitted as a diagnostic.** `Incomplete` rides the `Err` channel *only*; it
///   is a control signal to the caller ("feed me more"), not a user-facing error, so it never
///   flows through an [`Emitter`](crate::Emitter). Reporting it would misclassify a
///   resume-and-retry condition as a failure.
///
/// # The other half: a terminal condition is never an `Incomplete`
///
/// The never-recoverable law says nothing may *swallow* an `Incomplete`. Its **dual** says nothing
/// may *forge* one:
///
/// - **A terminal condition must never surface as an `Incomplete`.** An `Incomplete` promises the
///   caller that more input may fix this. A **terminal** condition — a resource-limit trip, and the
///   poison boundary it latches — promises the exact opposite: *no amount of input will fix this*.
///   Where the two meet, on a partial-input frontier, the terminal one **wins**; the limit is probed
///   and latched before the frontier holdback is consulted, so a trip fires even when the tripping
///   token ends exactly on the buffer end. Reporting it as incomplete would send a caller parsing
///   untrusted input back for more bytes to feed a limit that has *already* been exceeded and can
///   never fire — the resource limit, bypassed by anyone able to align a payload to a chunk
///   boundary. See the [input module docs](crate::input#terminal-beats-incomplete-and-they-never-substitute).
///
/// The two halves are one rule: an `Incomplete` and a terminal condition mean opposite things, and
/// neither may ever be spent as the other. The first half is enforced by recovery
/// ([`MaybeIncomplete`]); the second by the input layer's single scan-outcome classifier.
///
/// The payload is the [`offset`](Self::offset) at which the input ran out.
///
/// ```
/// use tokit::error::{Incomplete, MaybeIncomplete};
///
/// let inc = Incomplete::new(42usize);
/// assert_eq!(inc.offset(), 42);
/// // The marker reports itself as incomplete; that is what recovery keys off of.
/// assert!(inc.is_incomplete());
