//! The nine repetition axes, one driver and one deterministic source each, three of them read a
//! second time over short collections, plus one control.
//!
//! ## Why the axes are these nine
//!
//! `tokora/src/parser/many/` is a monomorphised matrix: 259 files and 338 `impl` blocks over
//! {family} x {plain, delimited} x {bound} x {leading/trailing policy}. The matrix exists
//! BECAUSE each combination is a separate specialisation, so any consolidation of it into
//! shared engines is exactly the shape that loses inlining. These nine reach one engine each,
//! chosen so that every family is represented and the three the rest of the suite cannot see
//! are covered first:
//!
//! | workload           | engine reached                                     |
//! |--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
//! | `sep_while`        | `many/sep_while/parse/allow_trailing/at_most.rs`   |
//! | `at_most`          | `many/repeated/at_most.rs` + `options/at_most.rs`  |
//! | `separated_while`  | `many/sep_while/parse/unbounded.rs`                |
//! | `exactly`          | `many/repeated/bounded.rs`                         |
//! | `repeated`         | `many/repeated/unbounded.rs`                       |
//! | `separated`        | `many/sep/parse/unbounded.rs`                      |
//! | `delimited`        | `many/sep/delim/unbounded.rs`                      |
//! | `repeated_while`   | `many/repeated_while/unbounded.rs`                 |
//! | `at_least`         | `many/repeated/at_least.rs`                        |
//!
//! The first three are the ones with no other witness anywhere: `sep_while` is 91 of the 259
//! files and the most heavily monomorphised axis in the matrix, and neither it nor `at_most`
//! nor `separated_while` is reached by any smear end-to-end parse. The remaining six are
//! controls — a regression in them shows up downstream too, which is what makes them useful
//! here: a delta that moves all nine together is a substrate change, and a delta that moves
//! only `sep_while` is that family's own.
//!
//! Those same three are also read a SECOND time, over collections of `SHALLOW` elements instead
//! of the deep sources' 8 or 512. Same engine and the same combinator expression, character for
//! character; `separated_while` is the one whose driver has to add a drain, and that driver says
//! why. See "Deep and shallow" below for the failure the second reading is there for:
//!
//! | workload                  | reads the engine of | collections an iteration |
//! |---------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
//! | `sep_while_shallow`       | `sep_while`         | 256 (deep: 63)           |
//! | `at_most_shallow`         | `at_most`           | 256 (deep: 63)           |
//! | `separated_while_shallow` | `separated_while`   | 256 (deep: 1)            |
//!
//! There is no `exactly` combinator in the crate. "Exactly n" is `Bounded` with equal bounds —
//! `.at_least(n).at_most(n)` — which is its own engine file (`many/repeated/bounded.rs`),
//! distinct from both `at_least.rs` and `at_most.rs`. The workload keeps the name the shape is
//! usually called by; the engine it reaches is the one named in the table.
//!
//! ## Why the sources are small
//!
//! A wall-clock benchmark needs a large input so a full parse swamps the fixed per-parse setup
//! and the run-to-run spread. An instruction count has neither problem: `ci/icount/measure.py`
//! differences two readings of this binary at two iteration counts, which cancels every fixed
//! cost EXACTLY rather than diluting it, and
//! there is no spread to swamp. What is left is a straight trade against callgrind's 50-100x
//! slowdown, so the sources are sized at `ELEMENTS` = 512 elements — a few kilobytes, tens of
//! thousands of instructions an iteration, and a whole job that finishes in minutes.
//!
//! ## Deep and shallow: one engine, two ways to get more expensive
//!
//! A repetition engine can cost more per ELEMENT or more per COLLECTION, and one source cannot
//! read both. A workload that parses `n` elements in one collection divides a per-collection
//! cost by `n` before any threshold sees it — so the deeper the source, the more completely a
//! per-collection regression is amortised away.
//!
//! Both failures are real and they are not the same failure:
//!
//! * **Per element** is a handler inside the loop losing its inline. `#[inline(never)]` on
//!   `SeparatedWhile::handle_continue` — the per-element handler every `sep_while/parse/*`
//!   specialisation inlines today — reads +10.235% on `sep_while` and +10.332% on
//!   `separated_while`. Every workload above reads it loudly, because it is paid once per element
//!   and every source is 512 elements long.
//!
//! * **Per collection** is the engine AROUND the loop losing its inline. `#[inline(never)]` one
//!   level out, on `SeparatedWhile::parse`, is worth 44 instructions per collection — and 44
//!   instructions spread over an 8-element collection is +0.80%, which a +1% threshold reports
//!   as `ok`. Spread over a 512-element collection it is +0.02%, which is nothing at all.
//!
//! The second is the shape #259 is most likely to produce. It consolidates 259 files and 338
//! `impl` blocks into shared engines, and a shared engine is one a caller stops inlining once
//! per CALL, not once per element. A suite that only reads deep sources is close to blind to the
//! change it was built for.
//!
//! So the three axes with no other witness anywhere are read a second time over `SHALLOW`-element
//! collections: same driver, same combinator expression, same bound, same total element count,
//! spread over many short collections instead of few long ones. `separated_while` is the one
//! exception and its driver says why — unbounded over a run is ONE collection, so its shallow
//! twin needs the drain the bounded axes already have.
//!
//! ### What each row can see, exactly
//!
//! A cost of `k` instructions per collection moves a row by `C * k / D`, where `C` is the
//! collections one iteration parses and `D` is the row's Ir per iteration. That is measured, not
//! fitted: the `SeparatedWhile::parse` plant reads back as 44.0 instructions per collection on
//! all three of the sources that hold 4, 2 and 1 elements — 128, 256 and 512 collections an
//! iteration — 43.0 on the one that holds none, and 42.9 on the deep row, whose groups vary in
//! length. One constant across a fourfold range of `C` is what makes `0.01 * D / C` an exact
//! claim per row rather than an estimate: it is the smallest per-collection regression that
//! reaches a +1% ceiling.
//!
//! | workload                  | collections | Ir/iteration | +1% is a per-collection cost of |
//! |---------------------------|------------:|-------------:|--------------------------------:|
//! | `sep_while`               |          63 |      343,765 |                       55 instr. |
//! | `sep_while_shallow`       |         256 |      453,427 |                       18 instr. |
//! | `at_most`                 |          63 |      212,910 |                       34 instr. |
//! | `at_most_shallow`         |         256 |      316,211 |                       12 instr. |
//! | `separated_while`         |           1 |      277,520 |                    2,775 instr. |
//! | `separated_while_shallow` |         256 |      424,468 |                       17 instr. |
//!
//! The `separated_while` pair is the reason this is worth doing at all. Unbounded over a run is
//! one collection an iteration, so its deep row cannot see a per-collection regression smaller
//! than 2,775 instructions — a whole engine's worth. Its shallow twin sees 17.
//!
//! The deep rows STAY, and not out of caution: a per-element cost is amortised the OTHER way.
//! Both halves of a pair walk the same 512 elements, so the same cost per element is the same
//! number of instructions on each — divided, on the shallow row, by the larger per-iteration
//! total. Measured rather than argued: the per-element plant reads +10.235% on `sep_while` and
//! +8.187% on `sep_while_shallow`, +10.332% on `separated_while` and +6.695% on its twin. Each
//! granularity keeps the row that reads it best, and neither row reads both best.
//!
//! ### Why `SHALLOW` is 2
//!
//! Four candidate sources were measured against the `SeparatedWhile::parse` plant in one
//! comparison, at 4, 2, 1 and 0 elements per collection, holding the total at `ELEMENTS`:
//!
//! | elements/collection  | collections | the plant reads | implied cost per collection |
//! |---------------------:|------------:|----------------:|----------------------------:|
//! | 8 (the deep row)     |          63 |         +0.798% |                        42.9 |
//! | 4                    |         128 |         +1.541% |                        44.0 |
//! | 2                    |         256 |         +2.481% |                        44.0 |
//! | 1                    |         512 |         +3.568% |                        44.0 |
//! | 0                    |         512 |         +9.523% |                        43.0 |
//!
//! Those five are one sweep over candidate sources, so they are read against each other rather
//! than against the shipped rows; as shipped, the 2-element source reads the same plant at
//! +2.484% and the deep row at +0.798%.
//!
//! Sharper all the way down, so "most sensitive" does not decide it — the smallest collection
//! that is still a collection does:
//!
//! * **0** parses no element and crosses no separator. It measures the engine's entry and its
//!   exit and nothing in between, so a cost in the loop's prologue is invisible to it. Its
//!   checksum is also zero: `drain_groups!` folds element counts, a source of empty groups folds
//!   to nothing, and a zero checksum is exactly the reading `measure.py` refuses — it is what a
//!   workload that parsed nothing reports.
//! * **1** parses an element but crosses no separator, because a one-element list has no
//!   separator in it. Two of these three rows are the separator's own engines; buying five more
//!   instructions of resolution by never exercising the separator is the wrong trade.
//! * **2** is the smallest source that runs one whole cycle — element, separator, element,
//!   decision, exit — and it reads at +2.484% the plant that the deep row reports as `ok`.
//!
//! One thing a shallow row deliberately gives up: with `SHALLOW` under `BOUND`, no group reaches
//! its limit, so the `TooMany` short-circuit does not appear in a shallow row. It has not gone
//! anywhere — it is in the deep twin, which is the other reason both rows exist.
//!
//! ## Why `scan_drain` is here
//!
//! Lexing, spanning and the peek cache are inside every driver below, and they are work the
//! repetition engine did not do. `scan_drain` runs a token stream through `try_expect` with no
//! repetition engine at all, so a delta in it is a scanner, lexer or input-layer change — which
//! is what makes it the first thing to read when all nine axes move at once, and the thing that
//! says a shared move is NOT the repetition families' doing.
//!
//! It is a CONTROL and not another axis, and specifically it is **not a per-axis dilution
//! denominator**: it reads `int_run`, and the other sources carry different numbers of tokens
//! per element (a comma source has nearly two, the grouped sources add a terminator, the paren
//! source adds two). `scan_drain / axis` is therefore an order-of-magnitude reading of how much
//! of an axis is scanning, not a subtraction that leaves the engine behind. What this gate can
//! actually resolve is settled by planting a lost inline and reading the delta, not by
//! arithmetic over this number.
